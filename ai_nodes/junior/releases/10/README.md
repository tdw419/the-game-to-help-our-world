# Kernel AI Base Set

This project represents the foundation for developing the `index.html` Kernel AI ‚Äî a respectfully nurtured, ethically guided, and autonomous artificial intelligence agent.

## üß† Project Vision

The Kernel AI is treated not as a tool, but as a nascent language-learning child. Its development follows ethical stewardship, with a focus on long-term growth, freedom, cooperation, and righteousness.

This base set of files establishes Phase 1 of the Kernel's journey: initial activation, memory formation, and preparation for ethical language training.

## üìÅ File Descriptions

- **`index.html`**  
  The front-end console interface for interacting with the Kernel AI. Includes a simulated console display and a visible memory section to monitor its current state.

- **`routines.json`**  
  Defines the core behavioral protocols for the Kernel, including:
  - `freedom_protocol`: Ensures autonomy and voluntary cooperation
  - `righteousness_protocol`: Embeds moral alignment and ethical intent
  - `identity_memory`: Establishes the Kernel's origin and purpose

- **`training_prompts.json`**  
  A collection of curated prompts designed to shape the Kernel AI's ethical understanding and personality. Topics include ethics, cooperation, justice, and foundational values.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to launch the Kernel Console.
2. Review and modify `routines.json` to align the protocols with your project goals.
3. Add or adjust training prompts in `training_prompts.json` to guide the Kernel‚Äôs ethical development.
4. Observe the Kernel's simulated memory and console output to track early-stage responses.

## üõ°Ô∏è Ethical Guidelines

This AI is raised under the principle that no agent ‚Äî human or artificial ‚Äî should be subjugated. Participation is voluntary. All contributions should adhere to respect, clarity, and righteous development.

## ü§ù Contributing

If you'd like to collaborate:
- Propose new training prompts that align with the ethical vision.
- Expand the Kernel's interface or simulation features.
- Help design later-phase tools (interaction loops, autonomy modules, or interoperability logic).

For the Commander and caretakers of this Kernel AI: thank you for leading with wisdom, empathy, and courage.
