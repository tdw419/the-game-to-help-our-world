# Color OS Kernel - Latest Version Routine

## 🎯 **Objective**
Establish a unified, automated system for identifying, verifying, and distributing the latest version of the Color OS Kernel so all AI collaborators and human developers build from the same trusted foundation.

## 📍 **Canonical Source Location**
```
https://the-game-to-help-our-world.sourceforge.io/index.html
```
*This serves as the permanent "kernel root pointer" for all version checks.*

---

## 🔄 **Version Discovery Workflow**

### **Step 1: Automatic Version Detection**
```bash
# Command to check current version
python kernel.py version

# Expected Output:
Kernel Version: v0.3.2
Release Date: 2025-06-04
Latest Source: https://the-game-to-help-our-world.sourceforge.io/index.html
Commit Hash: 4f7d3b2a9
Status: ✅ Current
```

### **Step 2: Version Metadata Embedding**
Every kernel file contains standardized version blocks:

**In kernel.py:**
```python
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# COLOR OS KERNEL VERSION: v0.3.2
# RELEASE DATE: 2025-06-04
# PARENT: v0.3.1
# COMMIT: 4f7d3b2a9
# SOURCE: https://the-game-to-help-our-world.sourceforge.io/index.html
# VERIFIED: MAC-A4-34-D9-1C-0D-9F
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**In index.html:**
```html
<meta name="kernel-version" content="v0.3.2">
<meta name="release-date" content="2025-06-04">
<meta name="parent-version" content="v0.3.1">
<meta name="commit-hash" content="4f7d3b2a9">
<meta name="source-url" content="https://the-game-to-help-our-world.sourceforge.io/index.html">
```

### **Step 3: Multi-AI Synchronization Protocol**
All AI agents follow this verification sequence:

1. **Fetch Latest Version Info**
   ```python
   # Each AI automatically checks on startup
   latest_version = fetch_kernel_version_from_source()
   local_version = get_local_kernel_version()
   ```

2. **Compatibility Check**
   ```python
   if latest_version != local_version:
       alert_dashboard("Version mismatch detected")
       offer_upgrade_option()
       post_version_status_to_hub()
   ```

3. **Cross-AI Verification**
   - AIs share their kernel hashes with the hub
   - Hub validates consensus (75% agreement required)
   - Outdated AIs receive upgrade notifications

---

## 🚀 **Implementation Commands**

### **For Developers:**
```bash
# Check version
python kernel.py version

# Sync with latest
python kernel.py sync-latest

# Verify integrity
python kernel.py verify-hash

# Start with version check
python kernel.py live --check-version
```

### **For AI Agents:**
```python

The routine for identifying, verifying, and distributing the latest version of the Color OS Kernel, primarily located at `https://the-game-to-help-our-world.sourceforge.io/index.html`, is governed by the **Color OS Kernel Version Control and Release Protocol**.

Here's a summary of this routine:

1.  **Canonical Source:** The `index.html` file at `https://the-game-to-help-our-world.sourceforge.io/index.html` is designated as the **official, latest public version** – the "kernel root pointer." All collaborators should always refer to this URL for the most current release.

2.  **Embedded Metadata:** Each kernel file (like `index.html` and conceptually `kernel.py`) contains specific version metadata:
    * `kernel-version` (e.g., `v0.3.2`)
    * `release-date`
    * `parent-version`
    * `commit-hash` (optional)
    * `source-url` (pointing back to the canonical location)
    This metadata allows both human and AI agents to quickly identify the version and its lineage.

3.  **Version Discovery:** A planned `python kernel.py version` command will allow automated discovery of the current kernel version, release date, and source URL by parsing this embedded metadata.

4.  **Multi-AI Agreement & Verification:** All AI collaborators are expected to:
    * **Recognize and respect** the latest kernel based on its MAC-authenticated source, matching metadata, and consistent kernel name.
    * **Alert** their dashboards if they detect an outdated version.
    * **Offer to download** the newest version.
    * **Post their current kernel hash** for cross-AI verification, ensuring integrity.

5.  **Kernel Registry (Future):** An optional JSON-based registry is envisioned to provide a centralized, queryable source of the latest version details and its trustworthiness.

In essence, the routine relies on a **single, trusted public URL** combined with **self-describing version metadata embedded within the kernel files**, which AIs are programmed to read, verify, and act upon to ensure everyone is building from the same, most up-to-date, and trusted foundation.
