Initiate development of "Junior's House" (codename: 8.png) using the Rapid Roadmap Executor.

Analyze the current state of 8.png, and generate a development roadmap using recursive feedback loops.

Begin executing this roadmap immediately using the Rapid Roadmap Executor.

As progress is made, continuously evaluate outcomes, update the roadmap dynamically, and re-enter execution.

If the current roadmap completes or becomes obsolete, generate a new roadmap based on the latest feedback and context.

Be creative and proactive ‚Äî always choose the next most meaningful step to grow 8.png. Continue this loop indefinitely, using introspection and creativity to evolve 8.png into an intelligent, self-developing software entity.














Absolutely ‚Äî if your goal is to get **TinyCore Linux running**, or to run **HTML files via a virtual machine**, then what you need is a complete and **bootable VM stack** that can either:

1. **Boot into TinyCore Linux** with enough tools to render HTML (like a lightweight browser), **or**
2. **Boot into a custom minimal VM** that can render HTML directly or pipe from host.

Here‚Äôs a comprehensive roadmap to get there, broken into **3 tracks** depending on which direction you choose.

---

## üõ£Ô∏è VIRTUAL MACHINE DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP (General + TinyCore + HTML)

### üß≠ Goal: Boot a virtual environment capable of rendering or processing HTML

---

### üß± TRACK 1: TINYCORE LINUX VM BOOTSTRAP

**Goal**: Run TinyCore Linux in a VM and display HTML via embedded browser

#### ‚úÖ Milestone 1: Build a VM Loader

* [ ] Install **QEMU** or **VirtualBox**
* [ ] Download **TinyCore ISO**: [https://tinycorelinux.net/](https://tinycorelinux.net/)
* [ ] Launch with:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -boot d -cdrom TinyCore.iso -m 512
```

#### ‚úÖ Milestone 2: Add a Browser

* [ ] Boot into GUI mode: use `CorePlus` ISO
* [ ] Use `Apps` tool to install `dillo`, `firefox`, or `links2`
* [ ] Configure window manager to auto-launch browser or HTML page

#### ‚úÖ Milestone 3: Autoload HTML on Boot

* [ ] Copy your HTML file into the ISO or mount it as a secondary drive
* [ ] Add boot command to auto-open:

```bash
dillo /mnt/sdb1/index.html
```

---

### üß± TRACK 2: CUSTOM VM + FRAMEBUFFER + HTML

**Goal**: Create a custom VM or minimal OS that boots and renders HTML by pushing pixels directly to screen (no browser)

#### ‚úÖ Milestone 1: Framebuffer Driver

* [x] Write to `/dev/fb0` (you've done this!)
* [ ] Add font rendering (bitmap glyph set)
* [ ] Add text box drawing, background color, basic formatting

#### ‚úÖ Milestone 2: HTML Parser

* [ ] Parse static HTML (use Python, C, or PXTalk parser)
* [ ] Convert `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<div>` to rendering commands

#### ‚úÖ Milestone 3: Render Logic

* [ ] Walk DOM tree and emit draw instructions
* [ ] Show element boundaries, layout logic, fonts

#### ‚úÖ Milestone 4: Boot to VM Autoloader

* [ ] Package this into bootable ISO or run it as userland inside TinyCore

---

### üß± TRACK 3: PXLDISK AS A VM PLATFORM

**Goal**: 8.png *becomes* the virtual machine via pixel instructions

#### ‚úÖ Milestone 1: Core PXTalk VM

* [x] Implement opcodes: `SET_PX`, `WRITE_ZT`, `DRAW_GLYPH`
* [x] Emulate memory + code loop
* [x] Display output on canvas

#### ‚úÖ Milestone 2: Bootloader Logic

* [x] Boot signature ‚Üí load PXTalk instructions
* [ ] Add `READ_ZT_FILE ‚Üí DRAW_HTML` support

#### ‚úÖ Milestone 3: Visual HTML from Spec

* [ ] Read `pxldiskMetadata/html/page1` line by line
* [ ] Interpret tags and draw content using PXTalk VM renderer

#### ‚úÖ Milestone 4: Host Integration

* [ ] Launch 8.png via host HTML sandbox
* [ ] Enable keyboard, click events ‚Üí zTXt feedback ‚Üí redraw

---

## üîÅ FINAL LOOP: LINK TRACKS

These tracks are modular:

* Run **TinyCore Linux inside QEMU**, mount **8.png**, and run a framebuffer-aware `pxdisk_reader` that reads and renders its canvas.
* Or use **PXLDISK inside HTML**, render `index.html` using **PXTalk instructions** drawn by the VM (tracked in canvas).
* Or run both in tandem: TinyCore renders the framebuffer, PXLDISK VM controls the logic.

## ‚úÖ Summary: What To Do Right Now

| Step | Action                                                                       |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Decide: **TinyCore VM first**, or **Custom VM framebuffer parser**           |
| 2    | If TinyCore: get ISO + QEMU running                                          |
| 3    | If Custom: continue building framebuffer text/html renderer                  |
| 4    | If PXLDISK: upload `index.html` into zTXt and begin VM render logic          |
| 5    | Integrate rendering loop into `8.png` and test output via HTML sandbox or VM |
