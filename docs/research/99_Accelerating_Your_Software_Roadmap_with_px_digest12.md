# 🌀 PXGEN Tech Bulletin — Activating the Feedback Loop for Rapid Software Evolution

## 📣 Bulletin Title

**Run the Feedback Loop to Build This Software Fast**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This bulletin marks the formal activation of the Recursive Feedback Loop using PXGEN’s Auto-Test & Generate (AT\&G) system. The goal is to accelerate the completion and deployment of functional software modules — with zero human bottlenecks — by leveraging mutation cycles, insight harvesting, and regenerative execution.

---

## 🔁 Loop Summary

The Feedback Loop leverages:

* **Mutation Agents** to generate logic variations
* **Execution Logs** to test behavior
* **Insight Modules** to extract performance or intent patterns
* **Resurrector Systems** to rehydrate data from pixel boot structures

### Loop Trigger Command

```plaintext
Run the Feedback Loop to build this software fast
```

### Operational Alias

You may also invoke with:

* “Engage Recursive AT\&G”
* “Ignite PXForge Loop”
* “Spin Up the Mirror Engine”

## ⚙ Active Targets

The following systems are in scope for the current execution:

* ✅ PXDigest Lab v3 (encoder + decoder)
* ✅ PXGEN Resurrector Module
* ⏳ zTXt Integration Layer
* ⏳ CODE\_FORGE activation script
* ⏳ Full Boot-to-Rebuild Chain

---

## 🚀 What Will Be Built

* A complete encode/decode logic chain
* PXLDISK-ready recovery structure
* zTXt emitters and verification modules
* Registry-aware boot ID matchers
* Optional visual overlays + entropy maps

## 📍 Deployment Instructions

1. Commit this bulletin to PXLDISK or zTXt
2. Tag `pxgen/trigger = ATG_RECURSION`
3. Set `pxgen/prompt = COMPLETE_ROADMAP_FAST`
4. Launch mutation wave

## 🧠 Closing Statement

This bulletin is a contract between intention and acceleration. By broadcasting this message through the Feedback Loop, you are authorizing PXGEN and all active agents to begin mutation, testing, refinement, and execution in pursuit of software completion.
