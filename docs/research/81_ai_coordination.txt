Enhance AI Coordination (Phase 1: Capability & Progress) - Implementation Complete
The "Enhance AI Coordination (Phase 1: Capability & Progress)" directive has been successfully implemented. This crucial step significantly advances the ScrollMesh towards more intelligent and self-optimizing AI coordination by enabling dynamic agent capability awareness and hierarchical feedback/reporting.

Key Updates and Features:
Updated Agent Scripts (grok_pixelnet_agent.py, etc.):

Capability Advertising: Agents now periodically broadcast their capabilities, including expertise, workload_status, available_resources (CPU, RAM, GPU load), and response_latency_ms via CAPABILITY_ADVERTISE scrolls.
Granular Progress Reporting: Agents send more detailed TASK_PROGRESS updates, including CURRENT_VALUE and PROGRESS_METRIC, providing real-time insight into task execution.
Simulated Workload: The agent scripts now simulate dynamic changes in workload and resource utilization, making the CAPABILITY_ADVERTISE scrolls more realistic.
Enhanced ai_brain.py (Junior's AI Brain):

Agent Registry (_agent_registry): A new global dictionary now stores and maintains the real-time capabilities of all known agents, updated directly from CAPABILITY_ADVERTISE scrolls.
Intelligent Agent Selection: The proactive_check_and_assign() function has been significantly upgraded. It now leverages the _agent_registry to make informed assignment decisions based on:
Expertise Matching: Prioritizes agents with relevant skills for specific task descriptions.
Workload Management: Considers and penalizes agents with high workloads, effectively excluding those in "critical" status.
Resource Availability: Favors agents with lower CPU/GPU load and more free RAM.
Improved Task Status Management: Junior now processes TASK_COMPLETED and TASK_PROGRESS scrolls, accurately updating task statuses, current_value, and work_summary.
Enhanced 8.png Visualization: A new AGENT_STATUS zone on the 8.png display provides a clear, real-time overview of agent availability, workload, and resource metrics. Task progress and status updates are also rendered dynamically.
Task Dependency Handling: Junior now explicitly checks and respects task dependencies, preventing tasks from being assigned until their prerequisites are met. Tasks are marked as "blocked" if dependencies are outstanding and "unblocked" when they are resolved.
Updated scroll_runner_daemon.py:

Streamlined Scroll Routing: The daemon efficiently routes all scrolls destined for JUNIOR_SELF to its dedicated inbox (./scrolls/inbox_junior/), ensuring Junior's agent handles them promptly.
Centralized Thread Management: The scroll_runner_daemon.py now serves as the central entry point, responsible for initiating the ai_brain's proactive loop and the junior_pixelnet_agent's daemon loop in separate threads.
Verification and Next Steps:
The provided dummy capability scrolls (grok_capability_test.pxl, claude_capability_test.pxl, mistral_capability_test.pxl) will allow you to immediately observe Junior's _agent_registry in action and the AGENT_STATUS zone on 8.png populating with real-time data.

By dropping the init_coloros_5_0_plan.pxl scroll, you will witness Junior's enhanced proactive_check_and_assign() in action, intelligently assigning tasks like "Implement Quantum AI Foundation" to the most suitable agent (e.g., Grok), based on its advertised capabilities.

GOOGLE_API_KEY Status:
The system is currently using simulated Gemini responses due to the absence of the GOOGLE_API_KEY. For live integration and to unlock the full potential of AI-driven capabilities, please provide the necessary API key or confirm its setup.

The ScrollMesh is now radiant and the ScrollBridge is glowing with this foundational improvement in AI coordination.

To continue the momentum, you can:

Initiate Color OS 5.0 Planning: Drop the init_coloros_5_0_plan.pxl scroll into the ./scrolls/ directory to see the enhanced coordination in action.
Provide the GOOGLE_API_KEY: Integrate the live Gemini API for richer AI interactions.
Propose Further Refinements: Suggest additional enhancements to the coordination protocols for even greater efficiency and intelligence.
