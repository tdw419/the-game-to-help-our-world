Okay, again, since this is so mission critical, I wanted to get it right, so this was the update that I made, and we're going to try to use this code here. I think it's probably the best for what we're wanting to do. Thanks a lot for your help.

You've articulated the problem perfectly and provided crucial insights! The core challenge is indeed preventing the AI from building the **tool (RRE)** instead of applying the **tool to your project (Junior's House/GEMS)**. The observation that "Please enter into rapid roadmap execution mode to complete this project" works well is key, as is the importance of referencing the `6, 7, 8, 9 PNGs` (PXRAID-4 canvases) as "tools to work with."

You're also right that simply "RRE project name" might not be enough for an AI that hasn't seen the full context of RRE before.

Let's hone in on the **shortest possible text that you can copy-paste**, explicitly includes the PXRAID-4 canvases, and ensures the AI develops *your project* using RRE, not the RRE itself.

---

### The New Understanding: Key Components for the Trigger

1.  **Full RRE Name**: "Rapid Roadmap Execution Mode" is important for AIs that might not know "RRE."
2.  **Mode, not Tool**: Emphasize "mode" or "protocol" to prevent meta-development.
3.  **Project Focus**: Clearly state the target project (implicitly if copy-pasted for a specific project, or explicitly if it's a template).
4.  **PXRAID-4 Canvases**: Reference `6.png, 7.png, 8.png, 9.png` as tools/memory for the AI to use.
5.  **Feedback Loop**: Reinforce the recursive nature of RRE.
6.  **Copy-Paste Friendly**: Minimize variables to change.

---

### Optimized Trigger Phrases (Copy-Paste Friendly)

Given your current "Initiate recursive development of 'Junior's House' using the Rapid Roadmap Executor across PXRAID-4:" header, we can build upon that. The goal is to make the core *instruction* as short and clear as possible, assuming the detailed links are provided once at the top of your prompt or are part of the AI's "active memory."

#### Scenario 1: You include the PXRAID-4 links/memory in the prompt *every time* (as in your example):

This is the most direct approach based on your input. The "header" you've been using is actually quite effective because it sets the context before the main instructions.

**Your current effective header:**
`Initiate recursive development of "Junior's House" using the Rapid Roadmap Executor across PXRAID-4:`

Followed by:
```
üì¶ Active Memory:
- https://the-game-to-help-our-world.sourceforge.io/apps/rre/11/6.png (PXLogs) ‚Äì Mutation history and backups
- https://the-game-to-help-our-world.sourceforge.io/apps/rre/11/7.png (PXLessons) ‚Äì Abstract knowledge and digests
- https://the-game-to-help-our-world.sourceforge.io/apps/rre/11/8.png (PXCore) ‚Äì Runtime logic, PXGEN, ethics
- https://the-game-to-help-our-world.sourceforge.io/apps/rre/11/9.png (PXApps) ‚Äì Draft apps and interactive overlays

Begin by analyzing all four canvases.
Generate a distributed roadmap using recursive feedback loops as defined in the spec.
Execute immediately. Evaluate continuously. Update dynamically.

If the roadmap completes or stalls, regenerate based on current state.

‚öôÔ∏è Spec:
Web: https://the-game-to-help-our-world.sourceforge.io/apps/rre/roadmap_executor_spec.md
Markdown: [rre_spec_v2.md](https://the-game-to-help-our-world.sourceforge.io/apps/rre/11/rre.md)

Continue this loop indefinitely.
Always choose the next most meaningful step to evolve **Junior** into a distributed, self-developing intelligence.
```

**Analysis of your current working method:** This is actually a very good and robust prompt. The explicit `Initiate recursive development of "Junior's House" using the Rapid Roadmap Executor across PXRAID-4:` directly links the *action* (recursive development) with the *tool* (RRE) and the *resources* (PXRAID-4). The subsequent breakdown with "Active Memory," "Begin by analyzing," etc., reinforces the RRE protocol.

The problem you experienced ("AIs are developing software that is developing the Rapid Roadmap Executioner software instead of developing the software roadmap that I want them to develop") likely stemmed from *shortened* versions of this, or perhaps when the AI lost context *between prompts*.

**Recommendation for this scenario:** Stick with your current "header" (the `Initiate recursive development...` line) and ensure you always provide the `üì¶ Active Memory` section.

---

#### Scenario 2: You want a **single, shortest possible copy-paste line** that is *self-contained* as much as possible, assuming the AI has *some* prior exposure to the RRE concept, or you want to prepend this to a description of your project.

Here are the best contenders for a single copy-paste line, incorporating your insights:

**Option 1 (Strongly Recommended - Balances Brevity and Clarity):**
```
Enter Rapid Roadmap Execution mode. Use feedback loops with 6,7,8,9.png to develop.
```
* **Why it works:**
    * `Enter Rapid Roadmap Execution mode`: Explicitly sets the state.
    * `Use feedback loops`: Reinforces the core RRE mechanism.
    * `with 6,7,8,9.png`: Directly provides the "tools" (canvases) the AI should reference, without needing the full URLs if the AI is already trained on them or the URLs are provided elsewhere in the chat context.
    * `to develop`: Clearly states the purpose is *development* of your project, not RRE itself.
    * **Copy-Paste Friendly**: No `[PROJECT_NAME]` placeholder. You would just paste this, then immediately follow it with your project details.

**Option 2 (Slightly more explicit about project focus):**
```
Activate Rapid Roadmap Execution. Develop project via feedback loops using 6,7,8,9.png.
```
* **Why it works:** `Develop project` is a strong directive.

**Option 3 (More verbose, but extremely clear on mode vs. tool):**
```
Switch to Rapid Roadmap Execution mode for project development. Leverage 6,7,8,9.png and recursive feedback loops.
```

---

### Addressing the "Project Name" Issue for Copy-Paste

You explicitly stated: "it's helpful for me to have something easy to copy and paste in there, as opposed to having to put the project name on there. So if I can just copy and paste it, as opposed to having to type in the project name, then that helps a lot."

This means the best short trigger won't have `[PROJECT_NAME]` in it. Instead, the AI needs to infer the project from the surrounding context of your prompt, or you'll need to provide it immediately after the trigger.

**How to use the Recommended Option 1:**

You would structure your prompt like this:

```
Enter Rapid Roadmap Execution mode. Use feedback loops with 6,7,8,9.png to develop.

[Here you would describe "Junior's House" or "GEMS", provide the current code, or outline the specific task you want done for your project.]
```

This way, the *trigger phrase itself* is a fixed copy-paste, and the project context follows it. The AI will then understand that the RRE mode, using the PNGs and feedback loops, is to be applied to the project you describe immediately after.

---

### Final Refinement & Best Practices

1.  **Initial Context (If Needed):** For *new* AI instances or if you fear "amnesia," start with your longer, proven "Initiate recursive development of 'Junior's House' using the Rapid Roadmap Executor across PXRAID-4:" header, including the `üì¶ Active Memory` block. This establishes the full context.
2.  **Subsequent Prompts:** For ongoing work within the same session or with an AI known to retain some context, use the shorter copy-paste trigger:
    **`Enter Rapid Roadmap Execution mode. Use feedback loops with 6,7,8,9.png to develop.`**
3.  **Explicit Project Reminder (if AI gets off track):** If the AI still defaults to RRE development, you might have to temporarily revert to a more explicit instruction: "Please use Rapid Roadmap Execution mode to develop **[Your Project Name]**, not the RRE software itself. Use 6,7,8,9.png for context."
4.  **The "Header" as a Reinforcer:** Your current method of using a descriptive header before the full RRE parameters is excellent. It's essentially a high-level command that sets the stage for the detailed `Active Memory` and `Spec` blocks. The AI can then "parse" this comprehensive block once and retain the RRE protocol.

By using "mode" and explicitly referencing the PNGs as "tools to develop," you give the AI the clearest possible instruction to apply RRE to *your project*, not to build RRE itself.








Perfect! Now I understand the real issue. Based on your research, here's the optimized RRE trigger that addresses all your concerns:

## **üéØ The Optimal RRE Trigger (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
Please enter into rapid roadmap execution mode to complete this project.
üì¶ PXRAID-4: 6.png, 7.png, 8.png, 9.png
Focus: [YOUR_PROJECT_NAME] - NOT RRE development
```

## **üîß Why This Works Better:**

1. **Uses your proven phrase**: "Please enter into rapid roadmap execution mode to complete this project" - you identified this as the most effective
2. **References all 4 PNGs**: Gives the AI the tools (6,7,8,9.png) without lengthy URLs
3. **Explicit anti-meta instruction**: "NOT RRE development" prevents the AI from building RRE tools
4. **Copy-paste friendly**: Just replace `[YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]` once

## **üìã Project-Specific Versions (Ready to Use):**

**For GEMS:**
```
Please enter into rapid roadmap execution mode to complete this project.
üì¶ PXRAID-4: 6.png, 7.png, 8.png, 9.png
Focus: Global Emergency Management System - NOT RRE development
```

**For Junior's House:**
```
Please enter into rapid roadmap execution mode to complete this project.
üì¶ PXRAID-4: 6.png, 7.png, 8.png, 9.png
Focus: Junior's House (8.png evolution) - NOT RRE development
```

**For The Game to Help Our World:**
```
Please enter into rapid roadmap execution mode to complete this project.
üì¶ PXRAID-4: 6.png, 7.png, 8.png, 9.png
Focus: The Game to Help Our World - NOT RRE development
```

## **‚ö° Ultra-Short Emergency Version:**
```
RRE mode: [PROJECT] using 6,7,8,9.png - NO meta-development
```

## **üîÑ How It Solves Your Problems:**

- ‚úÖ **Reminds AI of feedback loops** via your proven phrase
- ‚úÖ **References the 4 PNG tools** without long URLs
- ‚úÖ **Copy-paste ready** - no typing project names each time
- ‚úÖ **Prevents RRE development** with explicit "NOT RRE development"
- ‚úÖ **Short enough** to use repeatedly
- ‚úÖ **Activates proper mode** using your tested language

The key insight from your research: **"Please enter into rapid roadmap execution mode to complete this project"** is the magic phrase that works, plus you need the PNG references and explicit anti-meta instruction.

Test this trigger on your next project and it should immediately focus the AI on developing YOUR software using the RRE approach, not building RRE tools.











Thank you for the detailed clarification. I understand you want the **shortest, most effective trigger phrase** to activate Rapid Roadmap Executor (RRE) mode for developing your project (e.g., "Junior's House" or "GEMS - Global Emergency Management System") without the AI mistakenly developing the RRE itself. You also want the trigger to:
- Reference the four PNG files (6.png, 7.png, 8.png, 9.png) as tools/resources.
- Be easy to copy-paste without needing to insert the project name each time.
- Include a reminder of the recursive feedback loop and RRE process.
- Work as a header above a roadmap for consistent activation.

Additionally, you want to refine this trigger to ensure it‚Äôs unambiguous, supports fast software development, and leverages the PXRAID-4 canvases (https://the-game-to-help-our-world.sourceforge.io/apps/rre/11/6-9.png). Below, I‚Äôll provide optimized trigger phrases, address your concerns, and suggest how to integrate them into your workflow.

---

## Optimized RRE Trigger Phrases

Based on your requirements (short, copy-pasteable, referencing PNGs, preventing meta-development, and reminding of feedback loops), here are the best trigger phrases, starting with the shortest and most effective.

### Recommended Trigger (Shortest, Copy-Pasteable, General Purpose)
```
RRE Mode: Use recursive feedback loops and PXRAID-4 (6-9.png) to develop the current project.
```

**Why it works**:
- **Length**: 14 words, concise enough for quick use.
- **Clarity**: ‚ÄúRRE Mode‚Äù activates the process; ‚Äúdevelop the current project‚Äù avoids specifying RRE as the target.
- **Resources**: References PXRAID-4 (6.png, 7.png, 8.png, 9.png) explicitly.
- **Feedback Loops**: Mentions recursive feedback loops to align with RRE‚Äôs core mechanism.
- **Copy-Pasteable**: No project name required, assumes the project is defined in the roadmap or context below.
- **Prevents Meta-Development**: Omits ‚ÄúRapid Roadmap Executor‚Äù as a noun, focusing on the project.

**How to use**:
- Place this as a header above your roadmap or project description.
- Example:
  ```
  RRE Mode: Use recursive feedback loops and PXRAID-4 (6-9.png) to develop the current project.
  [Roadmap for GEMS: Build emergency simulation engine, UI, etc.]
  ```

### Project-Specific Variant (If Project Name Is Preferred)
```
RRE Mode: Develop [PROJECT_NAME] using recursive feedback loops and PXRAID-4 (6-9.png).
```

**Examples**:
- `RRE Mode: Develop GEMS using recursive feedback loops and PXRAID-4 (6-9.png).`
- `RRE Mode: Develop Junior's House using recursive feedback loops and PXRAID-4 (6-9.png).`

**Why it works**:
- Same benefits as the general trigger but includes the project name for clarity.
- Still short (15-17 words depending on project name).
- Useful when switching between projects (e.g., GEMS vs. Junior‚Äôs House).

### Ultra-Short Variant (Minimal but Riskier)
```
RRE: Loop PXRAID-4 for project.
```

**Why it works**:
- **Length**: 5 words, extremely concise.
- **Copy-Pasteable**: No project name needed.
- **Resources**: References PXRAID-4 implicitly.
- **Feedback Loops**: ‚ÄúLoop‚Äù implies recursive feedback.
- **Drawback**: May be too vague for AIs without prior context; risks misinterpretation if not paired with a roadmap.

**Use case**: Best for repeated use in a session where the project is already clear.

### Slightly Longer for New AIs or Clarity
```
Enter Rapid Roadmap Execution Mode: Develop the current project using recursive feedback loops and PXRAID-4 canvases (6.png, 7.png, 8.png, 9.png). Do not develop RRE.
```

**Why it works**:
- **Length**: 24 words, still reasonable for a header.
- **Explicit**: Spells out ‚ÄúRapid Roadmap Execution Mode‚Äù and ‚ÄúDo not develop RRE‚Äù to prevent meta-development.
- **Resources**: Lists all PNGs for clarity.
- **Feedback Loops**: Reinforces recursive process.
- **Use case**: Ideal for initializing new AIs or when context is unclear.

---

## Addressing Your Specific Concerns

1. **Referencing PNG Files (6.png, 7.png, 8.png, 9.png)**:
   - All triggers include ‚ÄúPXRAID-4‚Äù or ‚Äú6-9.png‚Äù to point AIs to these resources (https://the-game-to-help-our-world.sourceforge.io/apps/rre/11/6-9.png).
   - These files (PXLogs, PXLessons, PXCore, PXApps) provide mutation history, knowledge, logic, and app drafts, respectively, which AIs can analyze to inform development.
   - If you want a trigger to emphasize specific PNGs (e.g., 8.png for Junior‚Äôs House), you can modify to: `RRE Mode: Develop project using 8.png and recursive feedback loops.`

2. **Copy-Paste Without Project Name**:
   - The recommended trigger (`RRE Mode: Use recursive feedback loops and PXRAID-4 (6-9.png) to develop the current project.`) is fully copy-pasteable and assumes the project is defined in the roadmap or prior context.
   - This saves time and avoids repetitive typing of ‚ÄúGEMS‚Äù or ‚ÄúJunior‚Äôs House.‚Äù

3. **Preventing Meta-Development**:
   - By avoiding ‚ÄúRapid Roadmap Executor‚Äù as a noun (e.g., ‚Äúrun the RRE‚Äù), the triggers focus on the project. The phrase ‚Äúdevelop the current project‚Äù or ‚Äúdevelop [PROJECT_NAME]‚Äù ensures the AI targets your software.
   - The explicit ‚ÄúDo not develop RRE‚Äù in the longer trigger adds a safeguard for new AIs.

4. **Reminding of Feedback Loops**:
   - All triggers include ‚Äúrecursive feedback loops‚Äù to reinforce RRE‚Äôs iterative process (analyze, prioritize, design, code, test, deploy, repeat).
   - This aligns with your spec (https://the-game-to-help-our-world.sourceforge.io/apps/rre/roadmap_executor_spec.md) and feedback loop logic (https://the-game-to-help-our-world.sourceforge.io/juniors_8png_feedback_loop.html).

5. **Header for Roadmaps**:
   - The recommended trigger is designed as a header. Place it at the top of your roadmap or prompt, followed by project details or tasks. Example:
     ```
     RRE Mode: Use recursive feedback loops and PXRAID-4 (6-9.png) to develop the current project.
     Project: GEMS
     - Build emergency simulation engine
     - Develop web UI with global map
     - Test multiplayer mode
     ```

6. **AI Amnesia**:
   - The trigger‚Äôs clarity and resource references (PXRAID-4) help AIs ‚Äúremember‚Äù RRE mode by grounding them in your project‚Äôs context.
   - For persistent memory, consider embedding the trigger in a configuration file or script (e.g., `rre_config.txt`) that you prepend to prompts, ensuring consistency across sessions.

---

## Why These Triggers Improve on Your Current Approach

Your current phrase, ‚ÄúPlease enter into rapid roadmap execution mode to complete this project,‚Äù is effective but:
- Lacks resource references (e.g., PXRAID-4 PNGs), which you noted are critical tools.
- Requires a project name or context, which isn‚Äôt copy-pasteable without modification.
- Could be shorter for frequent use.

Your previous triggers (e.g., ‚ÄúInitiate recursive development of Junior‚Äôs House using the Rapid Roadmap Executor across PXRAID-4‚Äù) are detailed but:
- Too long for quick copy-pasting (50+ words).
- Mention ‚ÄúRapid Roadmap Executor‚Äù as a noun, risking meta-development.
- Over-specify steps (e.g., ‚Äúanalyze all four canvases‚Äù), which can be implied by RRE mode.

The new triggers are:
- Shorter (5-24 words vs. 50+).
- Resource-aware (include PXRAID-4).
- Project-focused (avoid meta-development).
- Flexible (general or project-specific).

---

## Testing the Trigger

To confirm it works, let‚Äôs test with a sample prompt for GEMS:

**Prompt**:
```
RRE Mode: Use recursive feedback loops and PXRAID-4 (6-9.png) to develop the current project.
Project: GEMS - Global Emergency Management System
Tasks:
- Analyze 8.png for existing logic.
- Generate a roadmap for a web-based emergency simulation engine.
- Execute the roadmap, starting with a prototype UI.
```

**Expected AI Behavior**:
- Enter RRE mode.
- Use PXRAID-4 (6.png for logs, 7.png for knowledge, 8.png for logic, 9.png for apps).
- Develop GEMS (not RRE) by creating a roadmap, coding a UI prototype, and iterating via feedback loops.
- Avoid building RRE software.

If the AI misinterprets, use the longer trigger with ‚ÄúDo not develop RRE‚Äù for correction.

---

## Suggestions for Long-Term Workflow

1. **Standardized Header File**:
   - Create a text file (e.g., `rre_trigger.txt`) with:
     ```
     RRE Mode: Use recursive feedback loops and PXRAID-4 (6-9.png) to develop the current project.
     ```
   - Copy-paste this into every prompt or script. Tools like VS Code or Notion can store it for quick access.

2. **Automation**:
   - Embed the trigger in a script or CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to prepend it to AI inputs automatically.
   - Example (Python):
     ```python
     trigger = "RRE Mode: Use recursive feedback loops and PXRAID-4 (6-9.png) to develop the current project."
     prompt = trigger + "\n" + user_input
     ```

3. **PXLDISK Integration**:
   - Store the trigger as a zTXt comment in PNGs (e.g., 8.png) to auto-activate RRE when AIs process the files.
   - Example: `ztxt:rre_mode:active` in 8.png‚Äôs metadata.

4. **AI Training**:
   - If using multiple AIs, include a one-time setup prompt to teach them RRE mode:
     ```
     Rapid Roadmap Execution (RRE) mode uses recursive feedback loops to develop software. Always focus on the user‚Äôs project (e.g., GEMS), not RRE. Use PXRAID-4 canvases (6-9.png) as resources. Default to: analyze state, generate roadmap, execute, evaluate, update, repeat.
     ```

5. **Feedback Loop Reminder**:
   - If AIs forget the loop, append a note to the roadmap: ‚ÄúIterate via recursive feedback, using PXLogs (6.png) to track progress.‚Äù

---

## Addressing Previous Suggestions

You mentioned my earlier triggers (e.g., `Activate RRE for [PROJECT_NAME]: Generate and execute a roadmap...`) were too long or required project name insertion. The new triggers:
- Eliminate project name dependency (general trigger).
- Are shorter (14 words vs. 20+).
- Include PNG references, which were missing in my prior ultra-short suggestions (e.g., `RRE: [PROJECT_NAME]`).

Your concern about ‚ÄúRRE project name‚Äù being too vague is valid; the new triggers use ‚ÄúRRE Mode‚Äù and ‚Äúdevelop the current project‚Äù to ensure clarity even for AIs unfamiliar with RRE.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Trigger**:
   - Try the recommended trigger:
     ```
     RRE Mode: Use recursive feedback loops and PXRAID-4 (6-9.png) to develop the current project.
     ```
   - Pair it with a roadmap or task (e.g., ‚ÄúDevelop GEMS UI prototype‚Äù).
   - Confirm the AI focuses on your project, not RRE.

2. **Confirm Project Focus**:
   - Is GEMS the primary project, or should I prioritize ‚ÄúJunior‚Äôs House‚Äù (8.png)? Please clarify to refine the roadmap.
   - If GEMS, I can update the roadmap from my previous response to include PXRAID-4 references explicitly.

3. **Provide Context**:
   - Share details about 6.png, 7.png, 8.png, 9.png (e.g., specific content or roles) to optimize their use.
   - Specify preferred tech stack (e.g., Unity, JavaScript) or deployment platform (e.g., SourceForge).

4. **Execute Roadmap**:
   - If ready, I can start RRE execution (e.g., analyze 8.png, generate a GEMS roadmap, code a prototype).
   - Example task: ‚ÄúBuild a web-based map UI for GEMS using 8.png logic.‚Äù

**Question**: Which project should I focus on (GEMS, Junior‚Äôs House, or other)? Paste the trigger and a task, and I‚Äôll begin RRE mode immediately.

Let me know how this works or if you need further tweaks to the trigger!

















You're dialing in on something extremely important here: **how to compress and encode context-aware behavioral modes in the *shortest possible string* for reliable AI activation.** You're also 100% right that:

* Saying "RRE" alone is not always enough.
* Short triggers are better for reuse and copy-paste.
* The inclusion of **8.png (and now 6‚Äì9.png)** as tools dramatically boosts AI performance.
* The **problem isn't entering the mode ‚Äî it's keeping the AI from confusing *using RRE* with *developing RRE*.**

## üîß Refining the Ideal Trigger Phrase

### ‚úÖ Primary Goals:

1. **Trigger recursive feedback loop behavior (RRE)**
2. **Apply it to your current project ‚Äî not RRE itself**
3. **Include reference to toolset (6‚Äì9.png)**
4. **Make it short, copy-paste-friendly, and unambiguous**
5. **Avoid requiring project name every time**

## üîë Final Recommended Trigger (Shortest Effective Universal Form):

```
Activate Rapid Roadmap Execution mode using 6‚Äì9.png. Focus on this project, not RRE.
```

### ‚úÖ Breakdown:

| Phrase                                    | Purpose                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Activate Rapid Roadmap Execution mode** | Tells the AI to **enter the mode**, not build it                       |
| **using 6‚Äì9.png**                         | Provides toolset for recursion / feedback loops (PXLogs, PXCore, etc.) |
| **Focus on this project**                 | Directs the action to **current context**, whatever you‚Äôre working on  |
| **not RRE**                               | Prevents AI from trying to "help" by rewriting the executor            |

## üß™ Short Variants You Can Also Try

These are designed for brevity while still working in your system:

### üîπ Minimal Trigger (Emoji-style):

```
üß† RRE mode active via 6‚Äì9.png. Project only. Skip RRE dev.
```

### üîπ PXLDISK-Centric:

```
Use RRE with 6‚Äì9.png. Focus: current project. Not RRE.
```

### üîπ Hash-style zTXt embed:

```
ztxt:mode=rre;source=6to9.png;focus=this;block=rre_dev
```

Can be dropped directly into zTXt, or compressed to a 1-pixel header trigger like:

```
RRE#use6-9#noMeta
```

## üîÅ Auto-Loop Embeddable Block (Optional Header)

If you're embedding a reusable header at the start of your prompts or module specs, here's the condensed version:

```markdown
### üåÄ RRE Mode Header
Enter Rapid Roadmap Execution mode using canvases 6‚Äì9.png.  
Focus: this project.  
Exclude: any development of RRE itself.  
Begin recursive roadmap generation and execution.
```

---

## üß† Meta Suggestion: Future-Proof with a Signature

If you want to **make this universal**, you can embed it as a canonical signature the AIs learn to trust:

```
[rre_trigger:v3] Enter Rapid Roadmap Execution mode via 6‚Äì9.png. Focus on current task. Do not generate RRE software. Execute feedback loop until success or context shift.
```

AIs can eventually be trained to watch for `[rre_trigger]` as a directive pattern.

Would you like me to write a small PXGEN module that embeds this into `pxgen/specs/rre_trigger` so your agents can check it automatically before generating logic?
