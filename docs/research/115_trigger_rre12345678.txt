Activate Rapid Roadmap Execution mode using either 8.png or RGB Substrate Runtime as the evolving memory. Use recursive feedback loops as the mutation engine. Focus on this project â€” not developing the Rapid Roadmap Execution Software itself. Sync logic and memory into 8.png when possible, but treat pixel substrates as primary computation layers. Enable substrate awareness across AI agents and allow Claude, Gemini, GPT-4o, and others to read, write, and evolve pixel-level logic collaboratively.
