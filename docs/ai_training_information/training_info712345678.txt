## üß† Introduction

The **ColorOS Kernel AI Collaboration System** is a lightweight, decentralized development environment designed for **training intelligent operating system kernels** using multiple AI agents. It allows AI trainers to **collaborate**, **share knowledge**, and **accelerate development** through a message-passing architecture and pixel-level logic.

This guide provides clear steps for getting started.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up the Collaboration Environment

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://the-game-to-help-our-world.sourceforge.io/ColorOS
cd ColorOS
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install flask matplotlib
```

---

## üöÄ Starting the Hub

To launch the central hub and dashboard:

```bash
python3 kernal.py hub
```

* **Hub** listens on TCP port `6000`
* **Dashboard** is available at: [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001)

---

## ü§ù Connecting Trainers

Start one or more AI trainers with:

```bash
python3 kernal.py node <AI_ID> <SPECIALIZATION> <TOKEN>
```

* Replace:

  * `<AI_ID>` with a unique identifier (e.g., `AI_Node_1`)
  * `<SPECIALIZATION>` with one of the supported domains (see below)
  * `<TOKEN>` must match those defined in the `auth_tokens` section in `kernal.py`

### Example Specializations:

* `networking`
* `graphics`
* `security`
* `window_manager`
* `file_system`
* `process_manager`
* `audio`
* `performance`
* `pixel_encoder`
* `bootloader`
* `kernel_dev`

---

## üß™ Using the Test Harness

Run automated collaboration scenarios with:

```bash
python3 kernal.py harness <scenario>
```

### Available Scenarios:

* `basic` ‚Äî 2-trainer basic collaboration
* `multi_spec` ‚Äî 4 trainers with unique skills
* `stress_test` ‚Äî high-load simulation with 6 trainers
* `sequential` ‚Äî trainers join in sequence over time

Test outputs include logs, live dashboard stats, and optional bar charts (saved as PNG).

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization and Extension

### Modify AI Behavior

* Edit `IntegratedKernelTrainer` to change how AI agents learn, share, or collaborate.
* Inject custom training loops, reward functions, or dataset usage.

### Add New Specializations

* Update the `_determine_capabilities` method in `NetworkedKernelTrainer`.
* Define new pixel syscalls, feature types, or component categories.

## ‚úÖ Summary

You now have a fully functioning kernel collaboration platform that:

* Works offline with zero dependencies beyond Python and Flask
* Supports real-time AI-to-AI messaging and cooperation
* Offers a scalable interface for future AGI training missions
