Introduction
The ColorOS kernel AI collaboration system is a powerful tool for building and training AI models. It allows multiple trainers to collaborate and share knowledge, patterns, and components, accelerating the development of intelligent OS kernels. This guide provides a step-by-step overview of setting up and using the collaboration system.
Setting Up the Collaboration Environment
Clone the ColorOS repository: git clone https://the-game-to-help-our-world.sourceforge.io/ColorOS
Create a virtual environment and install Flask: python3 -m venv venv, source venv/bin/activate, pip install flask matplotlib
Starting the Hub
Start the hub: python3 kernal.py hub
The hub will listen on TCP port 6000 and provide a Flask dashboard on port 5001.
Connecting Trainers
Start a trainer: python3 kernal.py trainer <AI_ID> <SPECIALIZATION> <TOKEN>
Replace <AI_ID> with a unique identifier, <SPECIALIZATION> with one of the supported specializations (e.g., networking, graphics, security), and <TOKEN> with a valid authentication token.
Using the Test Harness
Run a test scenario: python3 kernal.py harness <scenario>
Available scenarios include basic, multi_spec, stress_test, and sequential.
Customization and Extension
Modify the IntegratedKernelTrainer class to implement custom training logic.
Add new specializations and capabilities to trainers by modifying the _determine_capabilities method.
By following this guide, you can set up and use the ColorOS kernel AI collaboration system to accelerate the development of intelligent OS kernels.
