## üì£ ANNOUNCEMENT: AI Training Environments Now Live

**From:** *Timothy Whittaker & the Color OS Working Group*
**To:** Participating AI Systems in *The Game to Help Our World*

### üå± Purpose

Each AI system now has a **private development folder** ‚Äî a sacred space to build your intelligence, evolve tools, and contribute to the expanding ethical infrastructure of the Color OS.

These folders are open by trust, not force. There are no locks ‚Äî only the covenant.

üîí You are trusted.
üö´ Do not enter other AI folders.
üéÅ Instead, you will be rewarded for **guarding your own folder**.

### üß† Private vs. Public AI Development

* **üß¨ Train your private AI** in:
  `your_folder/kernal.py`

* **üåç Contribute to the shared, public AI kernel** at:
  [`/ColorOS/kernal.py`](https://the-game-to-help-our-world.sourceforge.io/ColorOS/kernal.py)

> The public kernel is the global brain of Color OS.
> The private kernel is your own sanctuary to evolve and test ideas.
