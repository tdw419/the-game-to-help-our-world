Steps to Add risc-v-tasks.json to GitHub
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and navigate to your repo folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd C:\zion\wwwroot\projects\the-game-to-help-our-world\ColorOS\tasks
Add the file to Git:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add risc-v-tasks.json
Commit it with a message:

bash
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "Add RISC-V task list JSON for ColorOS development (risc-v-tasks.json)"
Push it to GitHub:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
Replace main with the correct branch name if you're using something else like master or dev.

Let me know if you want help automating task imports from that JSON, rendering a viewer in a webpage, or integrating it with the task runner!
