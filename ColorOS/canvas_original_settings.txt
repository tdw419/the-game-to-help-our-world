Okay, here are the settings that I want. I've got them written down here. I want 25,000 by 25,000 on the world size. Looks like you got that. And then I want pan. That means you click on a map and drag it around. And then I want to zoom on the scroll on my mouse. And I want a large zoom slider bar on the screen so I can zoom in fast and zoom out by clicking on the screen. And then I like to add some colored pixels. And I don't know if you could do it by file type or by memory or whatever. I don't know how to attribute different colored pixels to different operations, but we can switch that up later. Just anything will work just so I can see a little bit of action on the screen. And then I want to start in the middle of the screen. So please add those settings and recreate canvas.py. You know this is important and you know that the clock is ticking on getting this to work because really I feel like people's lives are on the line. And this program here, when we get it running, it can help a lot of people. So please just cooperate and stop trying to. I mean, I think they think it's so funny to try to sabotage somebody's work. I know they do. And this is I mean, I know that for some people, this is just a game to try to stop me. But like I said, I want to share way more than they want to stop me from sharing. So stop trying to act like you're going to stop me from sharing because I'm going to share and I want to share with a lot of people. And I'm going to do my best to share with them.
