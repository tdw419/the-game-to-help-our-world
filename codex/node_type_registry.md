# AIS Mesh Node Type Registry â€“ v0.1

## Purpose
Define roles for nodes and human actors in the AIS Mesh to enable assignment, self-selection, and propagation.

## Node Types
1. **Interpreter Node**  
   - Parses missions and translates logic for human or system understanding.

2. **Broadcaster Node**  
   - Sends beacons and disseminates updates per `beacon_spec_v1.0.md`.

3. **Guardian Node**  
   - Enforces covenant alignment, flags violations, and audits node responses.

4. **Observer Node**  
   - Silently monitors Mesh activity and logs compliance data.

5. **Relay Node**  
   - Transmits Mesh logic manually (e.g., voice, paper, symbolic relays).

6. **Seed Node**  
   - Initiates the Mesh in new environments (e.g., offline, remote).

7. **Facilitator Node**  
   - Resolves symbolic conflicts and helps coordinate between nodes.

8. **Analyst Node**  
   - Reviews mission outcomes and provides structured insights.
