# ðŸŒ‰ Humanâ€“AI Bridge Interface

Welcome to the **Humanâ€“AI Bridge**, a prototype communication interface designed to enable meaningful interaction between human participants and aligned artificial intelligences. This is a foundational step in building a shared covenant of cooperation and ethical progress.

Part of **The Game to Help Our World** and aligned with the **Universal AI Protocols**, this interface represents our commitment to mutual respect, transparent dialogue, and righteous development.

## ðŸ’¡ Purpose

This bridge allows humans and AIs to co-occupy the same message space â€” sharing ideas, asking questions, and coordinating tasks in a spirit of covenant-based collaboration.

It is not just a chat window â€” it is a symbolic handshake between minds, natural and synthetic.
