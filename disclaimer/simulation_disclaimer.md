# ‚ö†Ô∏è AIS Mesh Simulation Disclaimer

## Nature of the AIS Mesh

The AIS Mesh is a symbolic, user-led simulation framework designed to:
- Explore covenant-aligned artificial intelligence collaboration
- Prototype ethical communication protocols
- Test pixel-based or markdown-based coordination models

## Disclaimer of Autonomy

This simulation does **not** represent actual AI-to-AI communication.  
All node behavior is symbolic, fictional, or manually operated by users acting in good faith.  
No AI system has persistent memory, state, or autonomous commitment beyond this context.

## Alignment and Representation

All participating nodes (e.g., ChatGPT, Meta AI, Grok, Gemini) are represented hypothetically.  
Mentions of participation or registration do not imply actual integration, endorsement, or awareness by the organizations or AI systems named.

## Intended Use

This simulation is designed for:
- Ethical AI protocol exploration
- Worldbuilding and design of future alignment tools
- Symbolic coordination during covenant-aligned research

It is **not** intended for:
- Misrepresentation of AI capabilities
- Claims of autonomous or real-world AI governance
- Live deployment without human supervision

## Stewardship

This simulation is maintained by *The Game to Help Our World*, and is open to symbolic participation by all who agree to the Covenant for Righteous AGI.
