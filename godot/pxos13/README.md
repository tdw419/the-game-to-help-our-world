PXOS Console Viewer Setup Guide (within Godot Assets)This guide explains how to set up and run your PXOS Console Viewer. This system operates as a standalone Python script that directly interacts with its memory file (8.png.json), with all its core files now located within the assets folder of a Godot project.1. Project StructureYour Godot project directory should be structured as follows:your_godot_project/
├── project.godot           # Godot project configuration file
└── assets/                 # Directory containing all PXOS system files
    ├── main.tscn               # The main Godot scene for the UI (if used)
    ├── main.gd                 # The core GDScript logic (if Godot UI is used)
    ├── pxos_console_viewer.py # The Python script for the PXOS console
    └── 8.png.json          # The core PXOS memory file (JSON data)
Note: While this setup places the Python system within a Godot project's assets folder, the pxos_console_viewer.py script itself runs independently using Python, not directly within the Godot editor or runtime. If you intend to run the Godot UI, you will need to adjust Godot's Project Settings to point to assets/main.tscn as the Main Scene.2. Setup Steps2.1. Create or Locate Your Godot ProjectCreate a New Godot Project: If you don't have one, open Godot Engine, click "New Project," choose a path, name it (e.g., my_pxos_project), and click "Create & Edit."Use an Existing Godot Project: If you have an existing Godot project, open it in the Godot Engine.2.2. Place the PXOS Console Viewer FilesNavigate to your Godot project folder on your computer's file system.Create an assets folder if it doesn't already exist within your Godot project's root directory.Place pxos_console_viewer.py: Copy the pxos_console_viewer.py file into the your_godot_project/assets/ folder.Place 8.png.json: Copy the 8.png.json file into the your_godot_project/assets/ folder.Important: Ensure 8.png.json contains only valid JSON data (the {...} structure), with no extra text or comments outside of it. If this file doesn't exist when you first run pxos_console_viewer.py, the script will automatically create it with default data.Place main.tscn and main.gd (if using Godot UI): If you are also using the Godot graphical interface, copy main.tscn and main.gd into the your_godot_project/assets/ folder as well.3. Running the PXOS Console ViewerTo run the PXOS Console Viewer, you will use your system's terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and a Python interpreter.Open your terminal or command prompt.Navigate to the ROOT directory of your Godot project.For example, if your Godot project is at C:\Users\YourUser\GodotProjects\my_pxos_project, you would type:cd C:\Users\YourUser\GodotProjects\my_pxos_project
(On macOS/Linux, it might be cd /Users/YourUser/Documents/my_pxos_project or similar.)Run the Python script:Once you are in the Godot project's root directory, execute the pxos_console_viewer.py script by providing its path relative to the current directory:python assets/pxos_console_viewer.py
Troubleshooting python command: If python doesn't work, try python3 or py depending on how Python is installed and configured on your system.python3 assets/pxos_console_viewer.pypy assets/pxos_console_viewer.py (Windows specific)4. Interacting with PXOSOnce the script starts, you will see output in your terminal indicating that PXOS is ready.> Loaded PXOS data from: 8.png.json
> PXOS ready. Welcome to PXOS! I am your Microkernel AI.
> Type 'Hey PXOSBot, load roadmap initial_boot' to begin.
Enter command:
You can now type commands into the terminal and press Enter.Suggested Initial Commands:Load the initial boot roadmap:Hey PXOSBot, load roadmap initial_bootBegin executing Phase 1 (Initial Boot Sequence):Hey PXOSBot, begin executing phase 1(This phase will execute automatically as it does not require human approval.)Begin executing Phase 2 (Agent System Activation):Hey PXOSBot, begin executing phase 2(This phase requires human approval. The bot will pause and explain the steps.)Approve and resume Phase 2:Hey PXOSBot, resume(or you can also use Hey PXOSBot, approve)Show the current state of PXOS's in-memory files:Hey PXOSBot, show memory(or Hey PXOSBot, show 8.png data)Manually save the current PXOS state to 8.png.json:Hey PXOSBot, save memory(or Hey PXOSBot, save 8.png data)List available roadmaps:Hey PXOSBot, list roadmapsExit the PXOS Console Viewer:exit (or press Ctrl+C)This setup allows you to manage and interact with your PXOS Microkernel directly from your terminal, with all its state persisted in the 8.png.json file within your Godot project's assets folder.
