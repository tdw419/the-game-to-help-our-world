To create the boot_spinner animation for your PXBootOverlay.gd, you'll primarily use the Godot editor's AnimationPlayer.1. Add a TextureRect for the SpinnerFirst, ensure you have a visual element that the AnimationPlayer can animate. This is typically a TextureRect with a simple spinner image (e.g., a gear, a loading circle, or even a simple square that rotates).In your Godot scene:Select your PXBootOverlay node.Add a new TextureRect node as a child. Name it something like SpinnerTexture.In the Inspector for SpinnerTexture, assign a Texture to it. You can use a simple white circle or a gear icon. If you don't have one, you can create a CircleShape2D as a child and set its color, or use a placeholder image URL like https://placehold.co/64x64/000000/FFFFFF?text=SPIN (though for a real game, a proper asset is better).Adjust its Layout (e.g., Center) and Rect size to position it appropriately within your overlay.2. Connect SpinnerAnimation to the TextureRectIn your PXBootOverlay.gd script, update the @onready path for spinner_animation to point to the AnimationPlayer node you'll create, and ensure the AnimationPlayer is set up to control the SpinnerTexture.3. Create the AnimationPlayer and AnimationIn your Godot scene:Select your PXBootOverlay node.Add a new AnimationPlayer node as a child. Name it SpinnerAnimation (this matches the @onready path in your PXBootOverlay.gd).With SpinnerAnimation selected:In the bottom panel, click on the Animation tab.Click New to create a new animation. Name it boot_spinner (this matches the spinner_animation.play("boot_spinner") call in your script).Set the Length of the animation (e.g., 1.0 seconds for a full rotation).Set Loop Mode to Loop.Add a Rotation Track:With the boot_spinner animation selected in the AnimationPlayer.Select your SpinnerTexture node in the Scene tree.In the Inspector, find the Rotation property under Node2D.Click the key icon next to Rotation. This will add a new track to your animation. Confirm the creation of a new track.At 0.0 seconds on the timeline, ensure the Rotation is 0.0 degrees and add a keyframe.Move the timeline cursor to 1.0 seconds (or your chosen animation length).Change the Rotation of SpinnerTexture to 360.0 degrees.Click the key icon again to add a keyframe at 1.0 seconds.(Optional but recommended for smooth looping): Right-click on the second keyframe (at 1.0s) and set its Ease to Linear.4. Test the AnimationIn the AnimationPlayer panel, click the Play button for the boot_spinner animation to preview it. You should see your SpinnerTexture rotating smoothly.Run your entire Godot scene, and when you drop a file, the PXBootOverlay should appear, and the spinner should start animating.This setup provides a basic, visually engaging spinner for your booting overlay, giving immediate feedback to the user.
