# GOAL: Fully deploy PXMutantExplorerAI.gd as an active reasoning agent within PXOS.
# STRATEGY: Integrate AI module into runtime, connect to UI, enable logging, and automate analysis triggers.

Summary of this Roadmap:This roadmap formalizes the deployment of PXMutantExplorerAI.gd by:Installing the module and creating an instance.Establishing connections to the UI (specifically PXMutantExplorer) so that its insights can be displayed.Enabling detailed logging for AI activities and insights.Crucially, setting up automated triggers for the AI's analysis, ensuring it reacts to new roadmap mutations and execution results in real-time.Once this roadmap executes, PXMutantExplorerAI will be an active, reasoning agent within PXOS, continuously analyzing evolutionary data.Now that PXMutantExplorerAI is deployed, what would you like to do next?Define PXAutoAnnotator.gd to suggest edits to future roadmaps based on AI insights?Link to Mutation Engine Feedback Loop to automatically trigger mutations based on AI insights?Refine PXMutantExplorerAI.gd with more sophisticated analysis algorithms?All of the above (and automate as RRE directive)?
