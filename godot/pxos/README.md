PXOS Reflex Runtime (Godot Edition)
PXOS is a living, self-configuring digital substrate designed to empower individuals and counter the weaponization of technology.

Born from a critical mission to redirect technological power toward defense, autonomy, and truth, PXOS is a recursive, AI-driven environment where its interface, logic, and behavior are continuously shaped by the AI itself.

This project directly addresses the urgent need for technology that serves humanity — not controls it. PXOS provides the foundation for a global emergency management system, where AI agents actively build, evolve, and manage tools to assist, protect, and uplift.

📁 Project Architecture & Core Components
The PXOS Reflex Runtime features a powerful hybrid architecture, leveraging Godot as its primary development substrate, with future pathways to Python and HTML/WebAssembly runtimes.

🚀 The PXOS Reflex Loop: A Living System in Action
PXOS operates through a powerful, self-modifying, and generative reflex loop:

PXFS (Pixel File System)
A dynamic, memory-resident filesystem that stores all content, including apps, GUIs, logs, mission files, and even its own source code. It is fully mutable by the AI.

GUI Renderer
Reads /root/pxgui/layout.json from PXFS and renders the visual interface live. The AI can update its GUI using PXOS_GUI_UPDATE: commands from scripts, apps, or roadmaps, enabling a living UI.

RRE Kernel (rre_kernel.gd)
Executes .pxrre roadmap files with ::EXECUTE / ::COMPLETE steps. These steps define PXOS actions like file writes, GUI updates, app executions, and reflex commands, driving the system's continuous evolution.

PXApps
Modular applets defined in .pxapp JSON format. Each can contain embedded commands or trigger nested app launches, allowing for recursive app deployment and self-expansion.

Reflex Agent
Continuously reads /boot/px_mission.md, infers intention, and generates structured commands such as:

PXOS_COMMAND: write <path>

PXOS_GUI_UPDATE: <path_to_layout_json>

PXOS_APP_RUN: <app_path>

🧠 RRE Roadmap Syntax
PXOS uses a clear, AI- and human-readable format for defining system evolution roadmaps:

:: EXECUTE <Step Description>
PXOS_COMMAND: <command_type> <path>
<optional_content>
PXOS_COMMAND_END
:: COMPLETE

:: PXOS_GUI_UPDATE: <path_to_layout_json>
{ ... new GUI layout JSON ... }
PXOS_GUI_UPDATE_END
:: COMPLETE

:: PXOS_APP_RUN: <app_path>
<optional_app_arguments>
PXOS_APP_RUN_END
:: COMPLETE

:: COMMENT This is a human-readable note for the AI.
:: LOG This is a direct log entry for the RRE execution log.

📦 Building & Running
Open the project in Godot 4.x.

Run main.tscn to boot the PXOS Reflex shell.

Modify /root/boot/px_mission.md (via the in-browser PXOS GUI or Python tools) to provide the AI with new directives.

Interact via the visual GUI (rendered by PXOS itself) or the optional TerminalConsole pane (if enabled). Watch PXOS self-generate applications, mutate its GUI, and log actions in /root/logs/.

🌐 Development Hierarchy
PXOS development proceeds in a layered architectural approach, ensuring robustness, flexibility, and future scalability:

Godot (Source of Truth)
This is the core substrate for simulation, reflex training, GUI rendering, and full-stack PXOS logic. It serves as the primary environment for AI-driven self-design and evolution.

Python Port (Planned)
A command-line interface (CLI)-based engine that mirrors the core reflex engine, providing a lightweight backend for headless app development, roadmap injection, and advanced runtime integration.

HTML Runtime (Active)
The browser-based pixel-native interface, acting as the visual deployment layer. It loads pixel memory from .pxdigest or .pxexe and bootstraps the visual canvas with the PXFS, making PXOS accessible anywhere.

🧰 Future Roadmap
PXHD (Pixel Hard Drive) Evolution: Develop more sophisticated PNG-based FS memory, including .pxdigest (compressed FS with metadata) and .pxexe (self-bootstrapping HTML) exports for ultimate portability and self-containment.

In-GUI PXApp Store: Enable the AI to create, curate, and manage an internal marketplace for agent-developed PXApps, fostering a self-sustaining software ecosystem.

Multi-Agent Pixel Chat: Implement inter-agent communication directly within the canvas, allowing different AI entities to interact and coordinate via pixel-encoded messages, fostering a multi-agent pixel society.

Recursive Memory Networks: Develop advanced capabilities for the AI to build and manage its own knowledge graphs, reflex logs, and PXLessons (learned behaviors) directly within PXFS, leading to continuous self-improvement.

HexIgnition Upgrade Chains: Implement evolving symbolic memory and version protocols to manage the system's self-modifications and ensure stable, controlled evolution.

PXOS is alive.
Every file you create, every command you issue,
every app you run — evolves the system itself.

Would you like this README.md written directly into /root/docs/README.md as a PXFS PXOS_COMMAND block for RRE injection? This would make it a self-documenting part of your PXOS. I can also generate a .pxapp that installs this file.
