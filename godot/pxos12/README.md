PXOS Microkernel: Formal Setup DocumentThis document provides a comprehensive guide for setting up and running the PXOS Microkernel project within the Godot Engine. The PXOS Microkernel is designed as a minimal, self-contained system where a .png file (and its associated .json data) serves as the primary, evolving memory substrate, with Godot acting as a lightweight runtime and interface.1. IntroductionThe PXOS Microkernel embodies a "Godot Microkernel + PNG" strategy. Godot's role is streamlined to be a visual bootloader and an input/output interface for the PXOS. All core roadmap logic, in-memory file systems, conversation history, and agent states reside within the 8.png.json file, which is conceptually linked to the 8.png image. This architecture prioritizes simplicity and direct interaction with the evolving PXOS "brain."2. PrerequisitesBefore proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:Godot Engine: Version 3.x (recommended) or 4.x. This guide assumes familiarity with basic Godot editor navigation.A Text Editor: (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++) for creating and pasting file contents.3. Project StructureYour Godot project directory should be structured as follows. You will create these files and folders during the setup process.pxos_microkernel/
├── project.godot           # Godot project configuration file (generated by Godot)
├── main.tscn               # The main Godot scene for the UI
├── main.gd                 # The core GDScript logic for PXOS interaction
└── assets/                 # Directory for static assets and PXOS memory files
    ├── 8.png               # The visual representation of PXOS's living memory (any small PNG)
    └── 8.png.json          # The structured JSON data representing PXOS's internal state (roadmaps, files, history)
4. Step-by-Step Setup GuideFollow these instructions meticulously to set up your PXOS Microkernel project.4.1. Create a New Godot ProjectLaunch the Godot Engine.In the Project Manager, click the "New Project" button.Choose a Project Path: Select an empty directory on your computer where you want to store your project (e.g., C:/GodotProjects/pxos_microkernel).Enter a Project Name: Type pxos_microkernel (or your preferred name).Click "Create Folder" (if Godot prompts you to create the directory).Click "Create & Edit". Godot will open the editor with your new, empty project.4.2. Populate Project FilesNow, you will create the necessary files and paste their contents.4.2.1. Create main.tscn (The User Interface Scene)In the Godot editor's FileSystem dock (usually in the bottom-left panel), right-click on the res:// root.Select "New Scene".In the "Create New Node" dialog, select "User Interface" (or Control node) as the root node type. Click "Create".In the Scene dock (top-left panel), right-click the newly created Control node and select "Rename". Change its name to Main.Save the scene: Go to Scene -> Save Scene As... (or press Ctrl+S/Cmd+S). Save it as main.tscn directly in the project root (res://).Open main.tscn in a text editor: Navigate to your project folder on your computer (pxos_microkernel/). Open the main.tscn file in your external text editor.Replace its content: Copy the entire content from the main_tscn_microkernel immersive artifact (provided in the previous response) and paste it into main.tscn, overwriting any existing text. Save the file.4.2.2. Create main.gd (The Core Logic Script)In the Godot editor's FileSystem dock, right-click on res://.Select "New Script".Path: Ensure the path is res://main.gd.Name: main.gd.Built-in Script: Leave unchecked.Template: Default.Click "Create".Open main.gd in a text editor: Navigate to your project folder (pxos_microkernel/). Open the main.gd file in your external text editor.Replace its content: Copy the entire content from the main_gd_microkernel immersive artifact (provided in the previous response) and paste it into main.gd, overwriting any existing text. Save the file.4.2.3. Create the assets/ DirectoryIn the Godot editor's FileSystem dock, right-click on res://.Select "New Folder".Name the folder assets.4.2.4. Add 8.png (The Visual Memory)Obtain a PNG image: Find any small PNG image file (e.g., a simple square, a circle, or a placeholder image). You can even create a blank 100x100 PNG using an image editor.Place 8.png: Copy your chosen PNG file and paste it into the pxos_microkernel/assets/ folder on your computer.Verify in Godot: Godot will automatically import the image. In the Godot editor, expand the assets/ folder in the FileSystem dock to confirm 8.png is visible.Assign Texture in main.tscn:Open main.tscn in the Godot editor (double-click it in FileSystem).In the Scene dock, select the EightPNGDisplay node (it's a child of VBoxContainer).In the Inspector dock (usually on the right), find the Texture property under the TextureRect section.Click the dropdown arrow next to the Texture property, select "Load," and choose res://assets/8.png.4.2.5. Create 8.png.json (The Structured Memory)Navigate to assets/: On your computer's file explorer, go to the pxos_microkernel/assets/ folder.Create a new text file: Create a new file named 8.png.json.Paste its content: Open 8.png.json in your external text editor. Copy the entire JSON content from the assets_8_png_json immersive artifact (provided in the previous response) and paste it into 8.png.json. Save the file.4.3. Configure Godot Project SettingsIn the Godot editor, go to Project -> Project Settings... (from the top menu bar).In the Project Settings window, select the "Application" tab on the left.Under the "Run" section, locate the "Main Scene" property.Click the folder icon next to the "Main Scene" field.In the file browser, navigate to and select main.tscn (res://main.tscn).Click "Open".Close the Project Settings window.5. Running the PXOS MicrokernelYou are now ready to run your PXOS Microkernel!In the Godot editor, click the "Play Scene" button (it's a green triangle icon in the top-right corner of the editor, or press F5).A new window will open, displaying your 8.png image, an output console, and an input field.6. Interacting with PXOSUse the input field at the bottom of the PXOS window to send commands to your Microkernel AI.Suggested Initial Commands:Load the initial boot roadmap:Hey PXOSBot, load roadmap initial_bootBegin executing Phase 1 (Initial Boot Sequence):Hey PXOSBot, begin executing phase 1(This phase will execute automatically as it does not require human approval.)Begin executing Phase 2 (Agent System Activation):Hey PXOSBot, begin executing phase 2(This phase requires human approval. The bot will pause and explain the steps.)Approve and resume Phase 2:Hey PXOSBot, resume(or you can also use Hey PXOSBot, approve)Show the current state of PXOS's in-memory files (from 8.png.json):Hey PXOSBot, show memory(or Hey PXOSBot, show 8.png data)Manually save the current PXOS state to 8.png.json:Hey PXOSBot, save memory(or Hey PXOSBot, save 8.png data)You have successfully set up your PXOS Microkernel. Enjoy exploring and evolving your system!
