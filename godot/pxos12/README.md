PXOS Microkernel Setup GuideThis guide will walk you through setting up and running your PXOS Microkernel project in the Godot Engine. This project uses a minimal Godot setup to interact with a .png file (and its associated .json data) as the core "living memory" of your PXOS.Project StructureThe project should have the following file and directory structure:pxos_microkernel/
├── project.godot
├── main.tscn
├── main.gd
└── assets/
    ├── 8.png                # Your visual boot brain (any small PNG image)
    └── 8.png.json           # Your structured memory/logic (JSON data)
Setup StepsFollow these steps to get your PXOS Microkernel running:1. Create a New Godot ProjectOpen the Godot Engine.Click on "New Project".Choose a Project Path (e.g., C:/Users/YourUser/GodotProjects/pxos_microkernel).Enter a Project Name (e.g., pxos_microkernel).Click "Create Folder" (if the folder doesn't exist).Click "Create & Edit".2. Add the Project FilesOnce the Godot editor opens, you'll need to create and populate the files:Create main.tscn:In the Godot editor's FileSystem dock (bottom left), right-click on res://.Select "New Scene".Choose "User Interface" as the root node.Rename the root node to Main.Save the scene as main.tscn in the project root (res://).Open main.tscn in a text editor (or Godot's built-in text editor by double-clicking it in FileSystem) and replace its entire content with the code provided in the main_tscn_microkernel immersive artifact.Create main.gd:In the Godot editor's FileSystem dock, right-click on res://.Select "New Script".Name it main.gd.Ensure its path is res://main.gd.Click "Create".Open main.gd in a text editor and replace its entire content with the code provided in the main_gd_microkernel immersive artifact.Create the assets/ directory:In the Godot editor's FileSystem dock, right-click on res://.Select "New Folder".Name it assets.Add 8.png:Place your 8.png image file (any small PNG will work as a visual placeholder) into the pxos_microkernel/assets/ folder on your computer.Godot will automatically import it.Important: Ensure the TextureRect node in main.tscn (named EightPNGDisplay) has its Texture property set to res://assets/8.png. If you created main.tscn manually, you might need to drag 8.png from the FileSystem dock onto this property in the Inspector.Create 8.png.json:In your computer's file explorer, navigate to the pxos_microkernel/assets/ folder.Create a new text file named 8.png.json.Open 8.png.json in a text editor and paste the JSON content from the assets_8_png_json immersive artifact.3. Run the ProjectIn the Godot editor, ensure main.tscn is set as your Main Scene. If not, go to Project -> Project Settings -> Application -> Run -> Main Scene and select res://main.tscn.Click the "Play Scene" button (F5 or the green triangle icon in the top right).The Godot application window should open, displaying the 8.png image, an output log, and an input field.Interacting with PXOSOnce the application is running, you can interact with the PXOS Microkernel using the input field at the bottom.Initial Commands to Try:Load the initial roadmap:Hey PXOSBot, load roadmap initial_bootBegin executing Phase 1:Hey PXOSBot, begin executing phase 1(This phase will execute automatically as it doesn't require human approval.)Begin executing Phase 2:Hey PXOSBot, begin executing phase 2(This phase requires human approval. The bot will pause and explain the steps.)Approve and resume Phase 2:Hey PXOSBot, resume(or Hey PXOSBot, approve)Show current memory data:Hey PXOSBot, show memory(or Hey PXOSBot, show 8.png data)Save current memory data (persists changes to 8.png.json):Hey PXOSBot, save memory(or Hey PXOSBot, save 8.png data)Enjoy interacting with your PXOS Microkernel!
