Here’s a full `README.md` tailored for your **Godot PXOS Host Runtime** project:

---

# PXOS Host Runtime (Godot 4.x)

**PXOS (Pixel Operating System)** is a visual runtime engine that interprets pixel-based logic encoded in a PNG file. This Godot 4.x prototype acts as a GPU-hosted virtual machine that executes PXTalk instructions embedded in each pixel.

## 🔧 Project Structure

```
PXOS/
├── pxos_host.gd        # Core GDScript logic for interpreting pixels as instructions
├── pxboot.png          # The boot disk image, encoded with pixel logic (your "program")
├── default_env.tres    # Godot’s default environment (optional)
└── project.godot       # Godot project settings
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Godot 4.x

Download the latest Godot 4 release from:
🔗 [https://godotengine.org/download](https://godotengine.org/download)

Choose the “Standard renderer” unless you’re targeting mobile or low-spec devices.

---

### 2. Clone or Set Up the Project

If you’re importing the project manually:

1. Launch Godot.
2. Click **Import** → Select the folder with your `project.godot`.
3. Set it up to your liking and hit **Run**.

---

### 3. Add Your PXBoot File

Replace or supply your pixel logic disk image as:

```
res://pxboot.png
```

This file must contain valid **PXTalk pixel instructions** (e.g. red channel used as toggle triggers, encoded opcodes via RGB).

If you don’t have one, use the included HTML UI with "💾 Export as PxBoot.png" to generate it from web canvas logic.

## 🧠 How It Works

* Loads `pxboot.png` into memory.
* Iterates through each pixel, reading RGB values.
* Runs basic logic:

  * If red channel > 0.5 → set black (0,0,0)
  * If red == 0 → set red (1,0,0)
* Refreshes image buffer every frame.
* Future opcodes and registers will interpret full RGB → PXTalk instructions.

---

## 🖼️ Recommended Pixel Format

* Format: PNG, RGB24, no alpha channel required.
* Dimensions: Any size, ideally matching 256x256 or greater.
* Encoded via web canvas (like the PXRAID Enhanced PXSeed AI Coder) or image generation logic.

## 🔜 Roadmap

* [x] Canvas loading and display
* [x] Real-time pixel scanning
* [ ] Full PXTalk interpreter (registers, opcodes, zTXt support)
* [ ] File I/O logic
* [ ] Modular instruction layering
* [ ] Introspective pixel evolution via feedback

## 📁 Related Tools

* **PXRAID AI Coder** (HTML): Generates and exports `pxboot.png` visually
* **PXTalk**: Pixel opcode language (RGB-based instruction design)
* **PXLDISK**: Master bootable substrate
