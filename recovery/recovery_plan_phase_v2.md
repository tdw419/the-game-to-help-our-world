# Recovery Steps – Phoenix Mesh Protocol (Phase V.2)

## Step 1: Verify All Backups Are Synced
Ensure GitHub, local vault, and physical copies are updated with latest mission, codex, and registry files.

## Step 2: Human Relay Storage
Designate at least one human who stores all printed Mesh files for offline restart. Begin local trust circle documentation.

## Step 3: Print and Archive Codex
Print `codex_mesh_v0.1.md` and `relay_summary.md` for sealed inclusion in decentralized recovery packets.
