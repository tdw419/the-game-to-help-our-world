You don't need to go back and find them! I will provide all the latest versions of the Python files and a couple of example .pxl and .md files here. This way, you'll have everything you need in one consolidated response to run the full Python-based PixelVault self-updating system.

Here are the latest versions of each file:

1. pixel_zones.py
This file defines the named zones on your 8.png canvas.

2. eight_png_manager.py
This module manages the conceptual 8.png display and renders visual output using Pillow.

3. pixelnet_transmitter.py
This module simulates low-level PixelNet communication.

5. ai_brain.py
This is your AI "brain" with capabilities for generating .pxl scrolls, roadmaps, and executable code.

7. feedback_loop_system.py
This is your meta-AI orchestrator, managing the overall system, tasks, roadmaps, and self-correction.

8. ai_self_write_scroll.pxl
This is the .pxl scroll that triggers the AI to generate new scrolls.

9. roadmap_test.md (Example Roadmap for Self-Tasking)
This is an example roadmap that feedback_loop_system.py will read to self-task.

Instructions to Run the System:
Create Directories:

Create a main project folder (e.g., PixelVault_System).
Inside it, create empty subfolders: scrolls, output, PixelVault, roadmaps, generated_code.
Inside scrolls, create processed and error folders.
Inside output, create ai_responses folder.
Save Python Files:

Save pixel_zones.py, eight_png_manager.py, pixelnet_transmitter.py, data_source.py, ai_brain.py, scroll_runner_daemon.py, and feedback_loop_system.py directly into your main PixelVault_System folder.
Save Example Files:

Save ai_self_write_scroll.pxl into the scrolls/ directory.
Save roadmap_test.md into the roadmaps/ directory. (Note: you might need to adjust the filename in feedback_loop_system.py's read_latest_roadmap_tasks if its timestamp doesn't match the one it generated previously, or simply let feedback_loop_system generate a new roadmap first).
Install Python Dependencies:
Open your terminal/command prompt in the main project folder and run:

Bash

pip install Pillow watchdog requests google-generativeai pyserial
Set up GOOGLE_API_KEY Environment Variable:
Get your Google Gemini API key from Google AI Studio. Then, set it in your environment:

Linux/macOS: export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY" (add to .bashrc/.zshrc for persistence)
Windows (Command Prompt): setx GOOGLE_API_KEY "YOUR_API_KEY"
Windows (PowerShell): $env:GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
Initial 8.png (One-Time Setup):
Run eight_png_manager.py once to create the initial 8.png file in your main project directory.

Bash

python eight_png_manager.py
Run the System (in separate terminal windows):

Terminal 1 (Meta-AI Orchestrator):

Bash

python feedback_loop_system.py --start-loop --interval 5
This will download 8.png to PixelVault/, start monitoring, and then begin checking roadmaps for self-tasks.

Terminal 2 (Pixel Display Daemon):

Bash

python scroll_runner_daemon.py
This will monitor the scrolls/ directory for .pxl files and execute them, updating 8.png.

Terminal 3 (Initial Task Trigger):
This is where you kick off the self-development. You can either:

Trigger an AI-generated scroll:
Bash

python feedback_loop_system.py --create-task "Generate display scroll: Show current time in a large font in the MAIN_CONTENT area."
Then observe the daemon processing AI_Greetings_Scroll_Generated.pxl.
Generate a roadmap that leads to code generation/testing (recommended to see the full loop):
Bash

python feedback_loop_system.py --create-task "Generate roadmap: A short roadmap for system self-improvement including a key deliverable to 'Generate code: Write a Python function for robust error logging with unit tests.'"
Observe Terminal 1 processing this. It will then self-task to "Automate roadmap task: Generate code...", which leads to code generation and testing.
Observation Points:

Terminal 1 (feedback_loop_system.py): Watch the INFO and DEBUG logs for task detection, AI calls, roadmap parsing, and self-tasking.
Terminal 2 (scroll_runner_daemon.py): Watch for logs indicating scroll execution and updates to 8.png.
8.png file: Continuously observe 8.png (refreshing your image viewer) in your main project folder to see the visual updates from the daemon.
./roadmaps/ directory: Check for newly generated .md roadmap files.
./generated_code/ directory: Crucially, look here for Python .py files that the AI has autonomously generated.
This setup will demonstrate the powerful, self-organizing, and self-improving capabilities of your PixelVault system.
