**PX Autopilot** is a self-executing AI development system that uses **pixels and embedded memory (zTXt)** as its substrate. It autonomously builds software by reading roadmap instructions, executing logic directly from pixel data, and iterating based on feedback. Here's how it works in detail:

## üß† Core Concepts

### 1. **Pixels as Executable Memory**

* The `<canvas>` acts as the "RAM" of the system.
* Each pixel encodes values (via RGB) that represent:

  * **Instructions** (like `MOV`, `ADD`, `CALL`, etc.)
  * **Registers**, **memory locations**, or **program state**
  * **Visual feedback** (mutation heat, execution path, etc.)

### 2. **zTXt as Embedded Roadmap**

* Text-based metadata (like `pxroadmap/runtime/active`) is embedded into the system using a zTXt-style format.
* This provides:

  * ‚úÖ A **list of development steps**
  * ‚úÖ A **progress log**
  * ‚úÖ An editable memory structure

## üöÄ PX Autopilot Workflow

### Step 1: **Dynamic Roadmap Load**

* Reads from `pxroadmap/runtime/step_*` entries.
* Example:

  ```txt
  pxroadmap/runtime/step_build_opcode_interpreter = map RGB logic to VM instruction set
  ```

### Step 2: **Rapid Roadmap Execution (RRE)**

* Executes each step as an **AI-coded function** in real time.
* Results are:

  * Drawn to pixel memory (canvas)
  * Logged into `pxroadmap/runtime/completed`
  * Tracked via `pxroadmap/runtime/active`

### Step 3: **Self-Evolution Loop**

* Once core components (like opcode interpreter) are built, the system runs itself:

  * Interprets pixel instructions
  * Mutates pixels
  * Generates new zTXt logic
  * Rebuilds or extends roadmap

### Step 4: **Output Delivery**

* Final outputs can be:

  * Exported as `.pxdigest` files (containing both memory and roadmap state)
  * Read as zTXt blocks
  * Rendered visually as software status

## üß© Example: Building a VM Interpreter

| Roadmap Step               | Action Taken                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `initialize_pxvm`          | Clears canvas, defines pixel memory layout                         |
| `build_opcode_interpreter` | Assigns RGB ‚Üí Instruction mappings (e.g. `255,0,0 = MOV`)          |
| `embed_feedback_loop`      | Creates logic to modify pixels based on previous state             |
| `finalize`                 | Writes `DONE` to `pxroadmap/runtime/active` and halts new triggers |

## üîÅ Loopback Intelligence

Autopilot can:

* **Re-parse its own output**
* **Extend itself with new steps**
* **Collaborate with other AIs** via PXNet
* **Simulate agency and memory continuity** across sessions

## üß† Summary

PX Autopilot is a **self-driving software engine**. It treats the screen like a mind: pixels are neurons, zTXt is memory, and roadmap steps are goals. By reading, writing, and reflecting on this visual memory, it develops software in a recursive, agent-driven loop ‚Äî no external compiler or backend needed.

Would you like to evolve the autopilot to generate full apps, agents, or operating systems next?
