# Job Simulations: The Game to Help Our World

This document outlines the design for the job simulation feature, a core component of "The Game to Help Our World." The goal of these simulations is to provide players with a sense of purpose and importance by allowing them to take on significant roles, make meaningful decisions, and see the impact of their real-world actions in a simulated environment.

## Core Concept

Job simulations are narrative-driven experiences that frame the existing missions within the context of a high-stakes, important job. Players choose a simulation and progress through a career path by completing real-world missions. Their actions directly influence the success of their simulated organization and the well-being of the world or galaxy.

The simulations are designed to be aspirational and educational, teaching players about leadership, problem-solving, and the interconnectedness of their actions.

## Simulation 1: CEO of a Green Energy Company

**Narrative:** The world is facing an unprecedented climate crisis. As the newly appointed CEO of "Helios Initiative," a fledgling green energy company, your mission is to transition the world to a sustainable energy future. You will need to build infrastructure, innovate new technologies, and inspire a global movement towards environmental stewardship.

**Progression:**

*   **Level 1: Intern** - Learn the ropes by performing basic environmental actions.
    *   **Missions:**
        *   Report injured wildlife to authorities.
        *   Clean up harmful debris from nature areas.
        *   Add alt-text to your social media images (to help spread the word).
*   **Level 2: Project Manager** - Organize and execute small-scale environmental projects.
    *   **Missions:**
        *   Organize small cleanup.
        *   Create wildlife-friendly garden spaces.
        *   Create walking maps for safe routes.
*   **Level 3: Director of Innovation** - Develop and promote new ideas for sustainability.
    *   **Missions:**
        *   Invent solution to local problem.
        *   Optimize existing community process.
        *   Create tools that help others help others.
*   **Level 4: CEO** - Lead the company, make high-level strategic decisions, and inspire global change.
    *   **Missions:**
        *   Advocate for better waste management.
        *   Create community cleanup group.
        *   Bridge communication gaps in community.

**Simulated Bank Account:** As players progress, they will see a "company budget" in their simulation dashboard. This budget will be a reflection of the points they've earned. Initially, this is purely a game mechanic, but the long-term vision is to connect this to real-world micro-loans or charitable donations for environmental projects.

## Simulation 2: Captain of an Interstellar Ark

**Narrative:** Humanity is on the brink of becoming a multi-planetary species. You are the captain of the "Odyssey," an interstellar ark carrying the first human colony to a new world. Your responsibility is to ensure the physical and mental well-being of your crew, maintain the ship's systems, and make the difficult decisions that will determine the future of humanity.

**Progression:**

*   **Level 1: Cadet** - Learn the fundamentals of community and crew support.
    *   **Missions:**
        *   Check in on someone struggling.
        *   Share mental health resources appropriately.
        *   Learn basic sign language phrases.
*   **Level 2: Officer** - Take on more responsibility for the well-being of a specific crew division.
    *   **Missions:**
        *   Practice active listening without giving advice.
        *   Create calm spaces in stressful environments.
        *   Organize walking groups.
*   **Level 3: Commander** - Lead a department and manage complex social and logistical challenges.
    *   **Missions:**
        *   Help during weather emergencies (simulated ship emergencies).
        *   Create neighborhood emergency contact list.
        *   Teach stress-reduction techniques.
*   **Level 4: Captain** - Command the "Odyssey," make critical decisions for the success of the mission, and guide humanity to its new home.
    *   **Missions:**
        *   Bridge communication gaps in community.
        *   Support addiction recovery efforts.
        *   Create regional action variations (for different parts of the ark).

**Simulated Bank Account:** The "Odyssey's" resources will be represented by a simulated bank account. This will be tied to the player's points. The long-term vision is to have these points translate into real-world value, such as scholarships for STEM education or funding for space exploration initiatives.

## Future Development

The job simulation feature is designed to be expandable. Future simulations could include:

*   **Global Emergency Manager:** Making real-time decisions during simulated global crises, with the potential for those decisions to be fed into real-world disaster response models.
*   **Lead Scientist of a Medical Research Lab:** Curing simulated diseases by completing health and wellness missions.
*   **Ambassador to a Newly Discovered Alien Civilization:** Fostering inter-species communication and understanding by completing missions focused on empathy and inclusion.

By grounding these simulations in real-world actions, we can empower players to see the hero in themselves and the importance of the job they already have: being a good steward of the Earth and a good neighbor to their fellow humans.
