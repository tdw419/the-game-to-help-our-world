# Job Simulations: A Pathway to Real-World Stewardship

This document outlines the design for the job simulation feature, a core component of "The Game to Help Our World." The goal of these simulations is to provide players with a sense of purpose and importance by allowing them to take on significant roles, make meaningful decisions, and ultimately translate their in-game accomplishments into real-world impact.

## Core Concept: High-Fidelity Simulation

Job simulations are narrative-driven experiences that frame existing missions within the context of a high-stakes, important job. The effectiveness of these simulations hinges on achieving three types of fidelity to ensure that the skills and psychological empowerment gained are transferable to real life (Game Transfer Phenomena - GTP).

*   **Functional Fidelity:** The simulation's systems and responses must accurately mimic reality. A decision to build a factory must have a realistic impact on the simulated environment's pollution levels.
*   **Psychological Fidelity:** The simulation must replicate the mental and emotional conditions of the role. Players will face pressure, ambiguity, and ethical conflicts inherent in leadership positions.
*   **Sociological Fidelity:** The simulation will model the team dynamics and stakeholder engagement required for success. Players will need to manage interprofessional relationships and build consensus.

## Simulation 1: CEO of a Regenerative Corporation

**Narrative:** You are the newly appointed CEO of a major corporation at a crossroads. Your mandate is to transition the company from a traditional, profit-driven model to a regenerative one that prioritizes the "triple bottom line": People, Planet, and Profit.

**Core Mechanics:**

*   **Strategic Decision-Making:** Players will manage supply chains, product design, and operations, with every choice impacting integrated performance reports.
*   **Triple Bottom Line Reporting:** Success is measured not just by financial statements (Income, Cash Flow) but also by:
    *   **Environmental Reports:** Pollution impact, energy efficiency, lifecycle analysis of products.
    *   **Social Assessments:** Labor practices, stakeholder engagement, community impact.
*   **Stakeholder Management:** Players will interact with a board of directors, government regulators, and community activists (simulated by an LLM), each with competing demands.

**Skill Transfer to GEMS:** This simulation is a direct training ground for the resource trade-offs and complex systems thinking required in disaster response. Balancing a corporate budget against ethical and environmental constraints is functionally equivalent to managing relief supplies in a crisis.

## Simulation 2: Captain of an Interstellar Ark

**Narrative:** You are the captain of an interstellar ark, a self-contained world carrying the future of humanity. Your mission is to manage the complex, interconnected systems of the vessel and its crew to ensure survival and arrival at a new home. This is a direct metaphor for managing "Spaceship Earth."

**Core Mechanics:**

*   **Complex Systems Management:** The ship is a character with its own "Character Sheet" (Hull Resilience, Life Support Efficiency). Players use Action Points (AP) to manage power distribution, diagnose system failures, and coordinate crew actions.
*   **Resource Scarcity:** Players must manage a closed-loop system with limited air, water, food, and fuel. Every decision has a long-term consequence for the viability of the mission.
*   **Crew Coordination:** Larger, more complex ships require effective delegation and management of multiple crew members (simulated or real players), testing sociological fidelity.

**Skill Transfer to GEMS:** This simulation develops skills in real-time command, logistics under extreme pressure, and systems diagnosis. Optimizing a space mission's resources is directly fungible with optimizing resource deployment in a disaster zone.

## The Graduation Pathway: The Global Emergency Management System (GEMS)

The ultimate goal of the simulation track is not just to "win the game," but to graduate into a real-world role. The simulations function as a sophisticated **Game-Based Assessment (GBA)**, a scientifically validated method for identifying talent.

*   **The Stewardship Score:** The system tracks player performance across all simulations, generating a comprehensive portfolio of their decision-making skills, ethical judgment, and resilience under pressure. This is their "Stewardship Score."
*   **The Invitation:** Players who consistently achieve a high Stewardship Score will be invited to participate in the final stage: the GEMS simulation. This is a high-fidelity crisis response scenario using real (anonymized) data, functionally equivalent to a professional Simulation Exercise (SimEx).
*   **The Real Job:** Successfully completing the GEMS SimEx results in a validated professional credential. This credential serves as a direct, skills-based pathway for accelerated placement into a real job within the GEMS network or affiliated NGOs. The simulation is the resume.
