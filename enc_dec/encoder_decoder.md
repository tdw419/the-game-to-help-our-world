Here's a foundational README-style document that explains how your system compresses and reconstructs files using header information and pixel data in PXLDISK:

# 📦 PXLDISK Compression and Reconstruction Protocol

*Version: 1.0 — Draft for Internal Use*

## Overview

PXLDISK enables high-density storage and retrieval of data using **RGB-encoded pixels**. Files are **compressed**, **hashed**, and represented through **minimal pixel headers**. These headers, when parsed by the PXLDISK VM or tooling layer (e.g., PXGEN, PXDigest Lab), allow **file resurrection from visual code**.

---

## 🧬 Core Concepts

### 1. **File Digesting**

Each file is converted into a `.pxdigest` package containing:

* **SHA-256 Hash**: A fingerprint ensuring identity and integrity.
* **GZIP-Compressed Content**: Reduces payload size.
* **Encoding Options**: Base64, hex, or binary streams.
* **Visual Signature**: Encoded into 1–4 RGB pixels for minimal representation.

> Example: `hello.txt` → GZIP → SHA256 → Base64 → Encoded into pixels → PXDigest

### 2. **Pixel Header Encoding**

A header typically consists of 4 key pixels:

| Pixel Position | Content Type           |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| (x, y)         | File ID or Type Glyph  |
| (x+1, y)       | SHA-256 Byte Summary   |
| (x+2, y)       | Compressed Length Info |
| (x+3, y)       | Format + Encoding Type |

These are mapped via a **glyph set**, which defines how RGB values are interpreted semantically (e.g., `R=42 → GZIP`, `B=16 → .txt file`).

## 🔧 Compression Process

1. **Input File**: User provides `file.txt`.
2. **Digest Creation**:

   * `gzip(file.txt)` → Compressed payload.
   * `sha256(file.txt)` → Unique ID.
3. **Pixel Mapping**:

   * First 3–4 bytes of the SHA-256 hash are encoded into RGB pixels.
   * Encoding scheme (Base64/Hex/Raw) + compression method is also encoded in a pixel.
4. **Metadata Emission**:

   * `zTXt` block or spec (e.g., `digest/specs/file.txt`) is written into PXLDISK.
   * Optional log written to `pxgen/history`.

---

## 🔁 Reconstruction Process

1. **Read Header Pixels**:

   * PXTalk VM or PXGEN reads boot identity pixels (e.g., `(128,0) → (128,3)`).
2. **Match Against Index**:

   * Fingerprint is looked up in `pxgen/fingerprint_index/`.
   * If match found, corresponding `.pxdigest` logic is invoked.
3. **Rebuild File**:

   * Compressed data is decompressed (GZIP).
   * Encoding is reversed (e.g., Base64 → binary).
   * Output is reconstructed file, optionally named via embedded metadata.

## 🧠 PXGEN Integration

* PXGEN watches `pxgen/prompt` and `pxgen/prompt_status`.
* When a reconstruction is requested, it emits logic to:

  1. Read pixel header.
  2. Lookup associated `.pxdigest` module.
  3. Spawn a file resurrection module.

Modules include:

* `digest_reader`: Reads pixel headers.
* `gzip_decoder`: Decompresses payload.
* `sha256_checker`: Verifies integrity.
* `file_emitter`: Writes result to a canvas, disk, or zTXt.

## 📊 Example

Let's say we encode `manifesto.txt` as follows:

* GZIP + Base64 = `ABCD...`
* SHA-256 starts with `8a 4e f3 b7`
* Pixel Header:

  * (128,0) = (138, 78, 243)
  * (128,1) = (183, X, X)
  * (128,2) = (GZIP flag, Base64 flag, file type)
  * (128,3) = CRC or terminator

Reconstruction logic:

```pxtalk
READ_PX 128,0 → R0
FIND_FP R0 → load pxdigest
DECOMPRESS → EMIT_TO_DISK
```

## 🚀 Applications

* **Data resurrection from image snapshots**
* **Minimal archival systems**
* **Executable logic embedded in color**
* **Self-healing AI agents using color identity**

## 🔒 Security Notes

* Always verify SHA-256 match before decompression.
* Headers must be error-corrected for transmission noise.
* Consider adding checksum redundancy for real-world deployment.

Suggest additional encoding types, headers, or reconstruction logic for new file types. We're aiming to support all common formats as `.pxdigest` profiles.
