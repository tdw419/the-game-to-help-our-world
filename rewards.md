# Economic and Reward Framework

This document outlines the economic and legal framework for the rewards system in "The Game to Help Our World." It details the transition from a simulated, in-game economy to real-world compensation, with a focus on mitigating legal and tax risks.

## The Simulated Bank Account: A High-Fidelity Utility

The inclusion of a simulated bank account is necessary to maintain high functional fidelity for the CEO and Captain roles, allowing players to manage simulated budgets, invest resources, and track profits/losses relative to ESG outcomes.

At the point of creation and throughout the active gameplay phase, this simulated bank account will contain currency that is strictly **non-convertible**. The digital asset within the game will have zero equivalent value in real currency and will not function as a substitute for real currency outside the game environment. This separation is crucial to ensure the simulated asset is not automatically deemed "property" for federal income tax purposes and to avoid the regulatory complexities associated with convertible virtual currency or securities.

## The Financial Nexus: From Virtual to Real Compensation

The transition from a simulated economy to real-world compensation presents significant legal and tax challenges. To mitigate these risks, the system will completely decouple the simulated bank account from any real economic value until the point of professional validation.

### The Critical Transition Point: A Phased Approach

1.  **Pre-Graduation Phase:** The simulated bank account will remain a **pure utility function**. All rewards are non-transferable, non-convertible points or tokens used exclusively for in-game progression and to enhance the simulation's fidelity.

2.  **The Conversion Event:** The transition to real value will occur only upon "graduation"—that is, the successful completion of the validated, high-fidelity GEMS assessment. The virtual account does not convert; instead, the final, psychometrically validated performance metrics are quantified, resulting in a **one-time cash award or job offer/bonus**. This award is explicitly treated as a one-time taxable payment for achieving a performance target, not ongoing service compensation. This structure is designed to avoid classifying the player as an employee during the simulation phase.

3.  **Post-Graduation Compensation:** The resulting GEMS job placement will be structured as formal W-2 employment, ensuring full compliance with tax and wage laws from the start.

### Regulatory Compliance Checklist

| Financial Phase | Simulated Bank Account / Status | Legal/Regulatory Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Pre-Graduation (In-Game Reward) | Non-convertible Utility Tokens, Simulated Currency. | Misclassification as a security or unauthorized gambling mechanism. | Enforce strict non-transferability; ensure reward mechanism is tied to utility, not speculative value. |
| The Conversion Trigger | Conversion of validated performance metrics to quantifiable financial value. | The player's actions in the game could be deemed "compensated work," triggering employee status. | Isolate conversion to a single, post-validation event (Graduation Award). Clearly define the award as compensation for an objective (not ongoing services). |
| Post-Graduation (Award/Job) | Real-world salary paid in fiat or convertible cryptocurrency. | FLSA/Wage and Hour violations; tax evasion risk if fiat withholding is not performed. | Structure the GEMS role as clear W-2 employment. Ensure all taxes are withheld in fiat USD regardless of whether compensation is delivered via cryptocurrency. |
