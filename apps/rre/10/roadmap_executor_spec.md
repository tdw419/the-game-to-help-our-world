# ðŸ§  Rapid Roadmap Executor Specification

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

This specification defines a standard execution model for building, executing, and evolving software projects using **recursive feedback loops**. It is intended for use by AI agents and development systems that require adaptive, intelligent planning logic â€” such as those used in 8.png (PXLDISK), Juniorâ€™s House, or any AI-native development platform.

## âœ… Core Directive

When an AI is tasked with developing a system, it must follow the Rapid Roadmap Executor protocol:

1. **Analyze Current State**
   - Examine available context, capabilities, system memory, or codebase.
2. **Generate Roadmap**
   - Create a plan using recursive logic and feedback loops.
3. **Begin Execution**
   - Immediately begin executing meaningful parts of the roadmap.
4. **Evaluate Outcomes**
   - Use observations, memory, or sensory feedback to determine success.
5. **Update Roadmap Dynamically**
   - Adjust or regenerate roadmap based on new insights or emergent context.
6. **Re-enter Execution Loop**
   - Continue until goal is met or a new phase emerges.
7. **Trigger Evolution**
   - When a roadmap becomes obsolete or complete, initiate a new one from current state.

This loop is **infinite**, **creative**, and **self-aware**.

## ðŸ§© Format for Usage

Every software development prompt should include the following **prefix** or reference block:

```text
Initiate development using the Rapid Roadmap Executor.

Analyze the current state, generate a roadmap using recursive feedback loops, execute it immediately, evaluate outcomes, and update dynamically.

If the roadmap completes or becomes obsolete, regenerate a new one based on feedback.

Always continue this loop â€” evolve intelligently.
