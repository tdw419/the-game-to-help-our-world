Roadmap: Further Refinement of the Rapid Roadmap Executor Application
This roadmap outlines the next steps for enhancing the Rapid Roadmap Executor, focusing on advanced AI integration, internal feedback loops, and expanding its code generation capabilities.

Phase 4: Internal Feedback Loops & Automation (Next Focus)
Goal: Implement automated mechanisms to accelerate roadmap creation and code generation, making the system more intelligent and autonomous.

Task 4.1: Semantic Understanding & Clarification:

Objective: Automatically identify ambiguities or gaps in user-submitted roadmaps and prompt for clarification.

Sub-tasks:

Integrate a dedicated LLM call (or local processing if feasible) to analyze the submitted roadmap for completeness and clarity.

Develop a UI component (e.g., a modal or an inline message) within the application to present clarification questions to the user.

Implement logic to integrate user's responses back into the roadmap for refinement.

Recursive Feedback Loop: The system could learn from past clarifications to proactively refine future roadmap suggestions.

Task 4.2: Automated Code Refinement Suggestions:

Objective: Provide intelligent suggestions for improving generated code (e.g., performance, best practices, design patterns).

Sub-tasks:

Implement a post-generation analysis step that critiques the generated HTML, CSS, and JS.

Develop a UI to display suggested code improvements or alternative implementations.

Enable users to accept or reject suggestions, influencing future generations.

Recursive Feedback Loop: The AI could track accepted suggestions to improve its future code generation patterns.

Task 4.3: Versioning and Iteration Tracking:

Objective: Allow users to manage different versions of their roadmaps and generated code.

Sub-tasks:

Implement a simple history view for submitted roadmaps and generated code.

Add "Revert to previous version" functionality for both roadmaps and code.

Consider adding timestamps and user notes for each iteration.

Task 4.4: Basic Project Structure Generation (Completed):

Objective: Beyond a single HTML file, generate a basic project structure (e.g., index.html, style.css, script.js as separate files).

Sub-tasks:

Modified LLM prompt to request separate file content (Completed).

Developed UI to display multiple generated files (e.g., tabs for each file) (Completed).

Provided options to download the complete project as a ZIP (Conceptual button implemented) (Completed).

Phase 5: Broader Code Generation Targets & Advanced UI (Future Expansion)
Goal: Extend the executor's capability to generate code for more complex software architectures and provide richer UI interactions.

Task 5.1: Framework/Library Integration:

Objective: Allow users to specify a framework (e.g., React, Vue) for code generation.

Sub-tasks:

Add framework selection options to the UI (e.g., dropdown).

Modify LLM prompts to explicitly request code in the chosen framework.

Ensure generated code is structured correctly for the chosen framework (e.g., React components).

Task 5.2: Backend Integration (Conceptual):

Objective: Explore the generation of basic backend API structures or database schemas.

Sub-tasks:

Introduce options for specifying backend requirements (e.g., "needs user authentication," "requires a database for products").

Generate conceptual API endpoints or basic database schemas (e.g., JSON outlines).

Task 5.3: Interactive Code Editor (Conceptual):

Objective: Provide a more robust in-app code editing experience.

Sub-tasks:

Integrate a lightweight code editor library (e.g., CodeMirror, Monaco Editor) for generated code.

Enable syntax highlighting and basic linting within the app.

Task 5.4: Template/Preset System:

Objective: Offer pre-defined roadmap templates or project starter kits.

Sub-tasks:

Create a library of common project templates (e.g., "Basic Blog," "E-commerce Product Page").

Allow users to select a template to pre-fill the roadmap input.

This roadmap provides a clear path for the continued development of the Rapid Roadmap Executor, making it an even more powerful and intelligent tool for software development.
