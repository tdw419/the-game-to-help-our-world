Rapid Roadmap ExecutorProject OverviewThe Rapid Roadmap Executor is an innovative web application designed to bridge the gap between software roadmaps and actual code generation. Leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs), it allows users to articulate their software vision in natural language and receive corresponding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. Furthermore, it can assist in the initial phase of project planning by generating structured roadmaps based on a high-level description.This project embodies the concept of "recursive feedback loops" by enabling iterative refinement of both roadmaps and generated code through continuous interaction with an intelligent assistant (the LLM).FeaturesThe current version of the Rapid Roadmap Executor includes the following core functionalities:Code Generation from Roadmap:Roadmap Submission: Users can input a detailed software roadmap in a text area.Integrated LLM Call: Upon submission, the application directly calls an LLM (Gemini 2.0 Flash) to interpret the roadmap and generate code.Multi-File Output: The generated code is intelligently split into index.html, style.css, and script.js files.Tabbed View: Code is displayed in a user-friendly tabbed interface for easy review of each file.Conceptual Download: A "Download Project" button indicates the future capability to package the generated files into a single downloadable archive.Roadmap Generation:Roadmap Prompting: Users can describe the kind of software project they envision.AI-Driven Roadmap Creation: The application uses an LLM to generate a structured software roadmap (in Markdown format) based on the user's prompt.In-App Display: The generated roadmap is displayed directly within the application, providing a starting point for project planning.How to UseTo use the Rapid Roadmap Executor:Access the Application: Open the index.html file (provided as the roadmap-executor-app immersive) in a web browser.Generate Code from a Roadmap:In the "1. Generate Code from Roadmap" section, type or paste a detailed description of the HTML application you want to build (e.g., "A simple calculator with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division buttons and a display screen.").Click the "Submit Roadmap & Get Code" button.The application will display the generated index.html, style.css, and script.js in separate tabs.Generate a New Roadmap:In the "2. Generate a New Roadmap" section, describe the software project you want a roadmap for (e.g., "A mobile application for managing personal finances, including income, expenses, and budget tracking.").Click the "Generate Roadmap" button.The application will display a structured roadmap in the output area below.Future EnhancementsAs outlined in the project roadmap, future versions aim to include:Semantic Understanding & Clarification: The ability for the AI to ask clarifying questions if a roadmap is ambiguous.Automated Code Refinement Suggestions: AI suggestions for improving the generated code's quality, performance, or best practices.Versioning and Iteration Tracking: Features to manage and revert to previous versions of roadmaps and generated code.Framework/Library Integration: Support for generating code in specific frameworks like React or Vue.Backend Integration (Conceptual): Exploratory features for generating basic backend structures.Interactive Code Editor: A more robust in-app code editing experience.
