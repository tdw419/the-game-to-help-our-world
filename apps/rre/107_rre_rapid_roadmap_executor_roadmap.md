Roadmap: Rapid Roadmap Executor ApplicationThis roadmap outlines the key phases and functionalities for developing the Rapid Roadmap Executor application, designed to streamline the process of software definition and generation.Phase 1: Core User Interface & Input (Completed)Goal: Establish a functional interface for users to submit their software roadmaps.Task 1.1: HTML Structure (Completed)Create index.html with basic layout.Include head section with metadata and Tailwind CSS link.Set up main container for the application.Task 1.2: Roadmap Input Area (Completed)Implement a <textarea> for users to type or paste their roadmaps.Add a clear placeholder text with an example roadmap.Task 1.3: Submission Mechanism (Completed)Add a "Submit Roadmap & Get Code" button.Implement client-side JavaScript to capture roadmap input upon button click.Task 1.4: User Feedback Message (Completed)Display a message box to confirm submission and guide the user on the next steps (i.e., prompting the AI).Implement basic validation for empty input.Task 1.5: Basic Styling (Completed)Apply Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing design.Ensure good typography and color scheme.Phase 2: AI Integration & Code Generation (Current Iteration - External AI)Goal: Enable the system to respond to submitted roadmaps by generating functional code.Task 2.1: LLM Interaction (Ongoing - Manual via Chat)User submits roadmap via the UI.AI (LLM) receives roadmap context via user prompt in the chat.AI generates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based on the provided roadmap.AI presents generated code in a new immersive document.Task 2.2: Code Generation Feedback Loop (Iterative via Chat)User reviews generated code and provides feedback (e.g., "make this section wider", "add a new feature").AI incorporates feedback and updates the code in the immersive.Phase 3: Enhanced Roadmap Creation (Completed)Goal: Introduce capabilities for the application itself to assist in generating or refining roadmaps.Task 3.1: Roadmap Prompting Interface (Completed):Added a new input field and "Generate Roadmap" button to the UI.Task 3.2: LLM Call for Roadmap Generation (Completed):Integrated a JavaScript fetch call to the Gemini API (gemini-2.0-flash) to generate structured roadmap content based on user prompts.Includes a loading spinner and basic error handling.Task 3.3: Display Generated Roadmap (Completed):Presents the generated roadmap directly within the application's UI, allowing for review and potential copy-pasting into the "Submit Roadmap" section.Phase 4: Internal Feedback Loops & Automation (Advanced Future)Goal: Implement automated mechanisms to accelerate roadmap creation and code generation.Task 4.1: Semantic Understanding & Refinement:Develop a system where the submitted roadmap is semantically analyzed by an internal LLM (or a highly optimized proxy).Automatically identify ambiguities or gaps in the roadmap and prompt the user for clarification within the app's UI.Task 4.2: Automated Code Refinement Suggestions:After initial code generation, the system could suggest alternative implementations, performance optimizations, or design improvements based on best practices and common patterns for the requested features.Recursive Feedback Loop Idea: If code generation fails or produces unexpected results, the system could automatically refine the internal understanding of the roadmap or even suggest rephrasing the roadmap for better outcomes.Task 4.3: Versioning and Iteration Tracking:Implement basic version control for roadmaps and generated code, allowing users to revert to previous versions and track changes.Phase 5: Broader Code Generation Targets (Future Expansion)Goal: Extend the executor's capability beyond single HTML files to more complex software architectures.Task 5.1: Multiple File Generation:Allow the system to generate multiple linked files (e.g., index.html, style.css, script.js).Task 5.2: Framework/Library Integration:Enable generation of code using specific frameworks (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) or libraries.Task 5.3: Backend Integration (Conceptual):Explore the generation of basic backend API structures or database schemas based on roadmap requirements.This roadmap will guide the evolution of the Rapid Roadmap Executor, moving from a manual interaction model to an increasingly automated and intelligent system.
