You're seeing this error because **PowerShell's execution policy is set to restrict script execution** on your system. By default, many versions of Windows prevent `.ps1` scripts from being run for security reasons.

## ðŸ”§ Solution: Temporarily Allow Scripts

Hereâ€™s how you can **enable script execution for your session**:

### âœ… Step 1: Open PowerShell as Administrator

1. Press `Win + X` and choose **Windows PowerShell (Admin)** or **Terminal (Admin)**.
2. Accept the User Account Control (UAC) prompt.

### âœ… Step 2: Allow Script Execution Temporarily

Run this command:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

Then, immediately run your script:

```powershell
C:\zion\wwwroot\projects\the-game-to-help-our-world\apps\rgb_os\core_os\15\windows_direct.ps1
```

This bypasses the restriction for **this session only**, making it safer.

## ðŸ”’ Permanent Options (Optional)

If you want to enable scripts permanently, you can choose:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

* **RemoteSigned** means:

  * Scripts you write can run.
  * Scripts downloaded from the internet must be signed by a trusted publisher.
