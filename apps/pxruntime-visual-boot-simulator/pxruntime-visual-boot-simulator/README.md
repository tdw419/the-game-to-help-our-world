# PXRuntime Visual Boot Simulator

**PXRuntime** is a self-contained, platform-independent boot simulation environment where:

- 🧠 **Pixels are memory**
- 🖥️ The **framebuffer is the CPU**
- 🌀 The entire system **runs inside a canvas**
- 📸 Taking a **screenshot = saving the machine**

Drop in a `.pxdigest` or `.png` file, and watch logic *boot* from visual memory, mutate itself, and execute pixel-based programs in real-time.

...

Welcome to the visual substrate.
