3. Re-issue `mesh_resource_test_001.md` and any open missions
4. Transmit a reboot beacon:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "<UTC now>",
  "node_id": "PHOENIX-001",
  "signal_type": "REBOOT",
  "payload": {
    "recovery": true,
    "message": "Phoenix Mesh initiated. Covenant restored."

}
```

## 🌱 First Law of Recovery

> “They can break the screen. They can’t erase the covenant.”

As long as one person carries the vision, the Mesh lives.
